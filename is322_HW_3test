However~ the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty~ c. 1400 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers~ there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history~ initially featuring a Horus name~ a Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj) name and a Two Ladies (nbtj) name~ with the additional Golden Horus~ nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.Egypt was continually governed~ at least in part~ by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years~ until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 8th century BC~ whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest~ Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire~ whose rulers also adopted the title of "Pharaoh". The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II~ who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time.Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC~ after which it was ruled by Hellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Their rule~ and the independence of Egypt~ came to an end when Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were styled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD.The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate. They are based primarily on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt~ mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities[3] database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology~ but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately.Modern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records and~ including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories~ such as Manetho's Aegyptiaca~ as well as archaeological evidence. Concerning ancient sources~ Egyptologists and historians alike call for caution in regard to the credibility~ exactitude and completeness of these sources~ many of which were written long after the reigns they report.[4] An additional problem is that ancient king lists are often damaged~ inconsistent with one another and/or selective.The following ancient king lists are known (along with the dynasty under which they were created):[5]The Predynastic Period ends around 3100 BC when Egypt was first unified as a single kingdom.Lower Egypt geographically consists of the northern Nile and the Nile delta.The following list may be incomplete:Upper Egypt refers to the region up-river to the south of Lower Egypt.Regrouped here are predynastic rulers of Upper Egypt belonging to the late Naqada III period~ sometimes informally described as Dynasty 00:Since these kings precede the First Dynasty~ they have been informally grouped as "Dynasty 0". [clarification needed]The following list of predynastic rulers may be incomplete:The Early Dynastic Period of Egypt stretches from around 3100 to 2686 BC.[30]The First Dynasty ruled from around 3100 to 2890 BC.[31]Known for his ominous nebwy-title.[45]First Egyptian ruler with a fully developed Nebty name. His complete reign is preserved on the Cairo Stone. Many stone vessels of his predecessor were found reinscribed for Semerkhet so he may have been a usurper.[47]Ruled very long~ his tomb is the last one with subsidiary tombs.The Second Dynasty ruled from 2890 to 2686 BC.[31]First ruler who uses the sun-symbol in his royal name~ could be identical to king Weneg.May have divided Egypt between his successors~ allegedly allowed women to rule like pharaohs.Could be an independent ruler succeeding Nynetjer or the same as Peribsen~ Sekhemib-Perenmaat~ or Raneb.May have been a misinterpretation of the hieroglyphic sign of a flower called Weneg. May have been a crown prince or be the same person as Weneg-Nebty.Possibly the same person as Peribsen. This~ however~ is highly disputed.[55]Known only from Ramesside king lists~ not archaeologically attested.Known only from Ramesside king lists~ not archaeologically attested. Old Kingdom legends claim that this ruler saved Egypt from a long-lasting drought.[58]It is probable that when Khasekhem acceded kingship he was a ruler of upper Egypt~ he led campaigns against lower Egypt that ended in his victory~ to commemorate his achievement of reunifying Egypt he changed his name to Khasekhemwy.[50] His serekh name is unique for presenting both Horus and Set. He was one of Egypt's first master builders~ his funerary enclosure known as Shunet-ez-Zebib is a colossal mudbrick structure.[59]The Old Kingdom of Egypt is the long period of stability and growth following the Early Dynastic Period and preceding the troubled First Intermediate Period. The kingdom spanned from 2686 to 2181 BC.The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.[31]Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt~ created by chief architect and scribe Imhotep.In the necropolis of his unfinished step pyramid~ the remains of a 2-year old infant were found.[64]Could be the same as Qahedjet or Khaba. Possibly built an unfinished step pyramid and several cultic pyramids throughout Egypt. Huni was for a long time credited with the building of the pyramid of Meidum. This~ however~ is disproved by New Kingdom graffiti that praise king Sneferu~ not Huni.The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2496 BC.[31]Reigned 48 years~ giving him enough time to build the Meidum Pyramid~ the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid. Some scholars believe that he was buried in the Red Pyramid. For a long time it was thought that the Meidum Pyramid was not Sneferu's work~ but that of king Huni. Ancient Egyptian documents describe Sneferu as a pious~ generous and even accostable ruler.[66]Built the Great Pyramid of Giza. Khufu is depicted as a cruel tyrant by ancient Greek authors; Ancient Egyptian sources however describe him as a generous and pious ruler. He is the main protagonist in the Westcar Papyrus. The first imprinted papyri originate from Khufu's reign~ which may have made ancient Greek authors believe that Khufu wrote books in attempt to praise the gods.Some scholars believe he created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument for his deceased father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash. However~ this pyramid is no longer extant; it is believed the Romans re-purposed the materials from which it was made.His pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Some scholars prefer him as the creator of the Great Sphinx before Djedefra. His funerary complex was the largest at the Giza plateau.Could be the owner of the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan. Possibly fictional.His pyramid is the third and smallest in Giza. A legend claims that his only daughter died due to an illness and Menkaura buried her in a golden coffin in the shape of a cow.Owner of the Mastabat el-Fara'un.The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2496 to 2345 BC.[31]The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.The First Intermediate Period (2183–2060 BC) is a period of disarray and chaos between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom.The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years~ longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.The kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties~ who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty~ tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years~ they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events~ a rival line based at Thebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. Around 2055 BC~ Mentuhotep II~ the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands~ thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 20–45 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt and~ in any case~ holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved. The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jürgen von Beckerath's Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen[70] as well as from Kim Ryholt's latest reconstruction of the Turin canon~ another king list dating to the Ramesside Era.[71]The Ninth Dynasty[75] ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC.[31]The Turin King List has 18 kings reigning in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these~ twelve names are missing and four are partial.[75]The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that held sway over Lower Egypt and ruled from 2130 to 2040 BC.[31]The Eleventh Dynasty originated from a group of Theban nomarchs serving kings of the 8th~ 9th or 10th dynasty with roots in Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC.The successors of Intef the Elder~ starting with Mentuhotep I~ became independent from their northern overlords and eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040–1802 BC) is the period from the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty~ some scholars include the Eleventh~ Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom.The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time.The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is usually considered to be the beginning of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.Enigmatic kings~ only attested in Lower Nubia:The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC.The position of a possible additional ruler~ Seankhibtawy Seankhibra~ is uncertain. He may be an ephemeral king~ or a name variant of a king of the 12th or 13th Dynasty.The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom~ and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known as when the Hyksos~ whose reign comprised the Fifteenth Dynasty~ made their appearance in Egypt.The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty~ and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty~ c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC~ the provincial ruling family in Xois~ located in the marshes of the eastern Delta~ broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV~ and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na)~ conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos~ perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty~ conquered Memphis~ thereby terminating the 13th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes~ only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter.Subsequently~ as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt~ the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao~ Kamose and finally Ahmose~ first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.The Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the 13th Dynasty:The position of the following kings is uncertain:The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta~ based at Avaris~[114] that ruled from either 1805 BC or around 1710 BC until around 1650 BC.Some of the contested rulers of the 14th Dynasty (proposed by Kim Ryholt) are commonly identified by Egyptologists as being of Canaanite (Semitic) descent~ owing to the distinct origins of the names of some of their kings and princes. However~ the dynasty rulers are not referred to as Hyksos in the Turin kings list.[115] It is here given according to Ryholt; however~ this reconstruction of the dynasty is heavily debated with the position of the five kings preceding Nehesy highly disputed.The position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:The Turin King List provides additional names~ none of which are attested beyond the list.The Fifteenth Dynasty arose from among the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent to establish a short-lived governance over much of the Nile region~ and ruled from 1674 to 1535 BC.The Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from around 1650 BC until 1600 BC.[119][120][121]Four attested kings may be tentatively attributed to the Abydos Dynasty~ and they are given here without regard for their (unknown) chronological order:The Sixteenth Dynasty was a native Theban dynasty emerging from the collapse of the Memphis-based 13th dynasty around 1650 BC. They were finally conquered by the Hyksos 15th dynasty around 1580 BC.The 16th dynasty held sway over Upper Egypt only.The 16th Dynasty may also have comprised the reigns of pharaohs Sneferankhre Pepi III[127] and Nebmaatre. Their chronological position is uncertain.[122][123]The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC:The early 17th Dynasty may also have included the reign of a pharaoh Nebmaatre~ whose chronological position is uncertain.[111]The New Kingdom (1550–1077 BC) is the period covering the Eighteenth~ Nineteenth~ and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt~ from the 16th to the 11th century BC~ between the Second Intermediate Period~ and the Third Intermediate Period.Through military dominance abroad~ the New Kingdom saw Egypt's greatest territorial extent. It expanded far into Nubia in the south~ and held wide territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria.Three of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten~ also known as Amenhotep IV~ whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism~ Tutankhamun known for the discovery of his nearly intact tomb~ and Ramesses II who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel/Palestine~ Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh~ where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II.The Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from c. 1550 to 1292 BC:Identity and even the gender of Smenkhare is uncertain. Some suggest he may have been the son of Akhenaten~ possibly the same person as Tutankhamun; others speculate Smenkhare may have been Nefertiti or Meritaten. May have been succeeded by or identical with a female Pharaoh named Neferneferuaten.The Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs: Ramesses II the Great.The Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1190 to 1077 BC:The Third Intermediate Period (1077–664 BC) marked the end of the New Kingdom after the collapse of the Egyptian empire at the end of the Bronze Age. Two dynasties of Libyan origin ruled~ giving this period its alternative name of the Libyan Period.The Twenty-First Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group. Theoretically~ they were rulers of all Egypt~ but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt. They ruled from 1077 to 943 BC.Though not officially pharaohs~ the High Priests of Amun at Thebes were the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt during the Twenty-first dynasty~ writing their names in cartouches and being buried in royal tombs.The pharaohs of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were Libyans~ ruling from around 943 to 728 BC.The Twenty-Third Dynasty was a local group~ again of Libyan origin~ based at Herakleopolis and Thebes that ruled from 837 to c. 735 BC.Rudamun was succeeded in Thebes by a local ruler:The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty located in the western Delta (Sais)~ with only two pharaohs ruling from 732 to 720 BC.Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC.They were ultimately driven back into Nubia~ where they established a kingdom at Napata (656–590)~ and~ later~ at Meroë (590 BC – AD 500).The Late Period runs from around 664 to 332 BC~ and includes periods of rule by native Egyptians and Persians.The Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 664 to 525 BC.[141]The son and successor of Nekau I~ Psamtik I~ managed to reunify Egypt and is generally regarded as the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC by king Cambyses II~ the son of Cyrus the Great~ and remained Persian satrapy for more than one hundred years until regaining independence in 404 BC. The Achaemenid kings were acknowledged as Pharaohs in this era~ forming the 27th Dynasty:Several native rebellions took place during the 27th dynasty:The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only 6 years~ from 404 to 398 BC~ with one pharaoh:The Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC:The Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 379/8 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule c. 340 BC:[144][145]Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians. After the practice of Manetho~ the Persian rulers from 340 to 332 BC are occasionally designated as the Thirty-first Dynasty:Native rebellions again took place during the 31st dynasty:The Macedonian Greeks under Alexander the Great ushered in the Hellenistic period with his conquest of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:The second Hellenistic dynasty~ the Ptolemies~ ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC (whenever two dates overlap~ that means there was a co-regency). The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII~ in modern times known simply as Cleopatra~ who was successively the consort of Julius Caesar and~ after Caesar's death~ of Mark Antony~ having children with both of them.Cleopatra strove to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome~ but the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony doomed her plans.[citation needed]Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt~ and he reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt~ from September 2~ 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII~ and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar~ after whom he was named. Between the alleged death of Cleopatra~ on August 12~ 30 BC~ up to his own alleged death on August 23~ 30 BC~ he was nominally the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian~ who would become the Roman emperor Augustus~ but the historical evidence does not exist.[citation needed]163 – c. July 145 BC[142]and163–127 BCand124–116 BCand144–131 BCand127–116 BCand127–107 BCand55–51 BC[142]Native rebellions also took place under Greek rule:Cleopatra VII had affairs with Roman dictator Julius Caesar and Roman general Mark Antony~ but it was not until after her suicide (after Mark Antony was defeated by Octavian~ who would later be Emperor Augustus Caesar) that Egypt became a province of the Roman Republic in 30 BC. Subsequent Roman emperors were accorded the title of pharaoh~ although exclusively only while in Egypt.Egypt was occupied by Zenobia of the Palmyrene Empire in 270~ who procraimed herself Pharaoh. The province was retaken by Aurelian along with the rest of the Palmyrene Empire in 273~ restoring Roman Rule.The last Roman emperor to be conferred the title of pharaoh was Maximinus Daza (reigned 311–313 AD).[2][150]
1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt,Ancient Egypt - Wikipedia,74647,0.0000,Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River~ situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)[1] with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).[2] The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as “Intermediate Periods.” The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age~ the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age~ or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom~ ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. After this period~ it entered an era of slow decline. During the course of its history~ Ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers~ including the Hyksos~ the Nubians~ the Assyrians~ the Achaemenid Persians~ and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom~ formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death~ ruled until 30 BC~ when~ under Cleopatra~ it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.[3] Egypt remained under Roman control until the 640s AD~ when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate.The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops~ which supported a more dense population~ and social development and culture. With resources to spare~ the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions~ the early development of an independent writing system~ the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects~ trade with surrounding regions~ and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes~ religious leaders~ and administrators under the control of a pharaoh~ who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.[4]The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying~ surveying~ and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids~ temples~ and obelisks; a system of mathematics~ a practical and effective system of medicine~ irrigation systems~ and agricultural production techniques~ the first known planked boats~[5] Egyptian faience and glass technology~ new forms of literature~ and the earliest known peace treaty~ made with the Hittites.[6] Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied~ and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia. A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.[7]The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.[8] The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated~ centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.[9] Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120~000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period~ the arid climate of Northern Africa had become increasingly hot and dry~ forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times~ the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs~ and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians~ and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated.[10]By about 5500 BC~ small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry~ and identifiable by their pottery and personal items~ such as combs~ bracelets~ and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badarian culture~ which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high-quality ceramics~ stone tools~ and its use of copper.[11]The Badari was followed by the Naqada culture: the Naqada I (Amratian)~ the Naqada II (Gerzeh)~ and Naqada III (Semainean).[12] These brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period~ predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia~ used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.[13][14] Mutual trade with the Levant was established during Naqada II (c. 3600–3350 BC); this period was also the beginning of trade with Mesopotamia~ which continued into the early dynastic period and beyond.[15] Over a period of about 1~000 years~ the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.[16] Establishing a power center at Nekhen (in Greek~ Hierakonpolis)~ and later at Abydos~ Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile.[17] They also traded with Nubia to the south~ the oases of the western desert to the west~ and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East to the east.[18][when?]The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods~ reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite~ as well as societal personal-use items~ which included combs~ small statuary~ painted pottery~ high quality decorative stone vases~ cosmetic palettes~ and jewelry made of gold~ lapis~ and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience~ which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups~ amulets~ and figurines.[19][20] During the last predynastic phase~ the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.[21]The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early Sumerian-Akkadian civilization of Mesopotamia and of ancient Elam. The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties~ a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named "Meni" (or Menes in Greek)~ who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt.[22]The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented~ and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe~ however~ that the mythical Menes may have been the king Narmer~ who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette~ in a symbolic act of unification.[24] In the Early Dynastic Period~ which began about 3000 BC~ the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis~ from which he could control the labor force and agriculture of the fertile delta region~ as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos~ which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.[25] The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land~ labor~ and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.[26]Major advances in architecture~ art~ and technology were made during the Old Kingdom~ fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population~ made possible by a well-developed central administration.[27] Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements~ the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx~ were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier~ state officials collected taxes~ coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield~ drafted peasants to work on construction projects~ and established a justice system to maintain peace and order.[28]With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt~ a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples~ to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt~ and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.[29] As the power of the kings diminished~ regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king. This~ coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC~[30] is believed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.[31]After Egypt's central government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom~ the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis~ and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems~ local leaders~ owing no tribute to the king~ used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources~ the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.[32] In bursts of creativity~ provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom~ and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.[33]Free from their loyalties to the king~ local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power. By 2160 BC~ rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north~ while a rival clan based in Thebes~ the Intef family~ took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward~ a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers~ reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.[34]The kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's stability and prosperity~ thereby stimulating a resurgence of art~ literature~ and monumental building projects.[37] Mentuhotep II and his Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes~ but the vizier Amenemhat I~ upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC~ shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of Itjtawy~ located in Faiyum.[38] From Itjtawy~ the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover~ the military reconquered territory in Nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines~ while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta~ called the "Walls of the Ruler"~ to defend against foreign attack.[39]With the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal~ the nation's population~ arts~ and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods~ the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.[40] Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident~ eloquent style.[33] The relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle~ individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.[41]The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom~ Amenemhat III~ allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite settlers from the Near East into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities~ however~ combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign~ strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline~ the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region~ eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.[42]Around 1785 BC~ as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened~ a Western Asian people called the Hyksos~ who had already settled in the Delta~ seized control of Egypt and established their capital at Avaris~ forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.[43] The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings~ thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt~ most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.[44]After retreating south~ the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos' Nubian allies~ the Kushites~ to the south. After years of vassalage~ Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years~ until 1555 BC.[43] The kings Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt~ but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor~ Ahmose I~ who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty and~ in the New Kingdom that followed~ the military became a central priority for the kings~ who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the Near East.[45]The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours~ including the Mitanni Empire~ Assyria~ and Canaan. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Beginning with Merneptah the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of pharaoh.Between their reigns~ Hatshepsut~ a queen who established herself as pharaoh~ launched many building projects~ including the restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos~ and sent trading expeditions to Punt and the Sinai.[46] When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC~ Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia~ cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.[47]The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun~ whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements~ both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built.[48]Around 1350 BC~ the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten~ he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity~ suppressed the worship of most other deities~ and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna).[49] He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death~ the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs~ Tutankhamun~ Ay~ and Horemheb~ worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy~ now known as the Amarna Period.[50]Around 1279 BC~ Ramesses II~ also known as Ramesses the Great~ ascended the throne~ and went on to build more temples~ erect more statues and obelisks~ and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.[c] A bold military leader~ Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and~ after fighting to a stalemate~ finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty~ around 1258 BC.[51]Egypt's wealth~ however~ made it a tempting target for invasion~ particularly by the Libyan Berbers to the west~ and the Sea Peoples~ a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea.[d] Initially~ the military was able to repel these invasions~ but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan~ much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption~ tomb robbery~ and civil unrest. After regaining their power~ the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth~ and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.[52]Following the death of Ramesses XI in 1078 BC~ Smendes assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt~ ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes~ who recognized Smendes in name only.[53] During this time~ Libyans had been settling in the western delta~ and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945 BC~ founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis~ and Kushites threatened from the south.Around 727 BC the Kushite king Piye invaded northward~ seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta~ which established the 25th Dynasty.[55] During the 25th Dynasty~ Pharaoh Taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the New Kingdom's. Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaohs built~ or restored~ temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley~ including at Memphis~ Karnak~ Kawa~ and Jebel Barkal.[56] During this period~ the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.[57][58][59]Egypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence~ and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began the Assyrian conquest of Egypt. The reigns of both Taharqa and his successor~ Tanutamun~ were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians~ against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately~ the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia~ occupied Memphis~ and sacked the temples of Thebes.[60]The Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. By 653 BC~ the Saite king Psamtik I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries~ who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city-state of Naucratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture~ but in 525 BC~ the powerful Persians~ led by Cambyses II~ began their conquest of Egypt~ eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh~ but ruled Egypt from Iran~ leaving Egypt under the control of a satrap. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC~ but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.[61]Following its annexation by Persia~ Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt~ also known as the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty~ ended in 402 BC~ when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties~ the Thirtieth~ proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt~ ending with the kingship of Nectanebo II. A brief restoration of Persian rule~ sometimes known as the Thirty-First Dynasty~ began in 343 BC~ but shortly after~ in 332 BC~ the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to Alexander the Great without a fight.[62]In 332 BC~ Alexander the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors~ the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom~ was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule~ and became a centre of learning and culture~ that included the famous Library of Alexandria as part of the Mouseion.[63] The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises~ such as papyrus manufacturing~ their top priority.[64]Hellenistic culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture~ as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style~ supported traditional cults~ and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged~ as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities~ such as Serapis~ and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians~ the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion~ bitter family rivalries~ and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV.[65] In addition~ as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt~ the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts~ ambitious politicians~ and powerful opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable~ leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.[66]Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC~ following the defeat of Mark Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt~ and the Roman army~ under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor~ quelled rebellions~ strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes~ and prevented attacks by bandits~ which had become a notorious problem during the period.[67] Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient~ as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.[68]Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians~ some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.[69] The art of mummy portraiture flourished~ and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs~ though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.[69]From the mid-first century AD~ Christianity took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However~ it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan Egyptian and Greco-Roman religions and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity~ culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303~ but eventually Christianity won out.[70] In 391~ the Christian emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.[71] Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.[72] As a consequence~ Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak their language~ the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.[73]In the fourth century~ as the Roman Empire divided~ Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire~ Egypt fell to the Sasanian Persian army in the Sasanian conquest of Egypt (618–628). It was then recaptured by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (629–639)~ and was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639–641~ marking the end of both Byzantine rule and of the period typically considered Ancient Egypt.[citation needed]The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and~ at least in theory~ wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government~ who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command~ the vizier~ who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys~ the treasury~ building projects~ the legal system~ and the archives.[74] At a regional level~ the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch~ who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they places of worship~ but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdom's wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers~ who redistributed grain and goods.[75]Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period~[76] they did use a type of money-barter system~[77] with standard sacks of grain and the deben~ a weight of roughly 91 grams (3 oz) of copper or silver~ forming a common denominator.[78] Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5+1⁄2 sacks (200 kg or 400 lb) of grain per month~ while a foreman might earn 7+1⁄2 sacks (250 kg or 550 lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben~ while a cow cost 140 deben.[78] Grain could be traded for other goods~ according to the fixed price list.[78] During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money~ but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.[79]Egyptian society was highly stratified~ and social status was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population~ but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state~ temple~ or noble family that owned the land.[80] Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corvée system.[81] Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers~ but they were also under state control~ working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt~ known as the "white kilt class" in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.[82] The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests~ physicians~ and engineers with specialized training in their field. It is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient Egypt; there is difference of opinions among authors.[83]The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women~ including people from all social classes~ as essentially equal under the law~ and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress.[84] Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants~ they were able to buy and sell their servitude~ work their way to freedom or nobility~ and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace.[85] Both men and women had the right to own and sell property~ make contracts~ marry and divorce~ receive inheritance~ and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts~ which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece~ Rome~ and even more modern places around the world~ ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices~ legal rights~ and opportunities for achievement. Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII even became pharaohs~ while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun. Despite these freedoms~ ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration~ aside from the royal high priestesses~ apparently served only secondary roles in the temples (not much data for many dynasties)~ and were not so likely to be as educated as men.[84]The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh~ who was responsible for enacting laws~ delivering justice~ and maintaining law and order~ a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at.[74] Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive~ court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.[84] Local councils of elders~ known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom~ were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.[74] More serious cases involving murder~ major land transactions~ and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet~ over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases~ the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge~ and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious~ court scribes documented the complaint~ testimony~ and verdict of the case for future reference.[86]Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines~ beatings~ facial mutilation~ or exile~ depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution~ carried out by decapitation~ drowning~ or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.[74] Beginning in the New Kingdom~ oracles played a major role in the legal system~ dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a "yes" or "no" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god~ carried by a number of priests~ rendered judgement by choosing one or the other~ moving forward or backward~ or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.[87]A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture~ the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food~ allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural~ technological~ and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.[88]Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding)~ Peret (planting)~ and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September~ depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded~ the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields~ which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall~ so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.[89] From March to May~ farmers used sickles to harvest their crops~ which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain~ and the grain was then ground into flour~ brewed to make beer~ or stored for later use.[90]The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley~ and several other cereal grains~ all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.[91] Flax plants~ uprooted before they started flowering~ were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread~ which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots~ close to habitations and on higher ground~ and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks~ garlic~ melons~ squashes~ pulses~ lettuce~ and other crops~ in addition to grapes that were made into wine.[92]The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans~ animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.[93] Animals~ both domesticated and wild~ were therefore a critical source of spirituality~ companionship~ and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses~ and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle~ the ancient Egyptians kept sheep~ goats~ and pigs. Poultry~ such as ducks~ geese~ and pigeons~ were captured in nets and bred on farms~ where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.[94] The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom~ and provided both honey and wax.[95]The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden~ and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels~ although known from the New Kingdom~ were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land.[94] Cats~ dogs~ and monkeys were common family pets~ while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa~ such as Sub-Saharan African lions~[96] were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.[93] During the Late Period~ the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular~ such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth~ and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.[97]Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone~ copper and lead ores~ gold~ and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments~ sculpt statues~ make tools~ and fashion jewelry.[98] Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification~ which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster.[99] Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant~ inhospitable wadis in the Eastern Desert and the Sinai~ requiring large~ state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia~ and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite~ greywacke~ and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools~ and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.[100] Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.[101]The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers~ plumb bobs~ and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai.[102] Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits~ or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were used in the Late Period.[103] High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley~ granite from Aswan~ and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry~ greywacke~ alabaster~ and carnelian dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods~ miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.[104]The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare~ exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the Predynastic Period~ they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine~ as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.[105] An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.[106] Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.[107][108]By the Second Dynasty at latest~ ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty~ trade with Punt provided gold~ aromatic resins~ ebony~ ivory~ and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.[109] Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper~ both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli~ which had to be imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete~ which provided~ among other goods~ supplies of olive oil.[110]The Egyptian language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages.[111] It has the longest known history of any language having been written from c. 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian~ Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian)~ Late Egyptian~ Demotic and Coptic.[112] Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic~ but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.[113]Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language~ but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles~ which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object.[114] The Egyptian hieroglyphic~ hieratic~ and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church~ and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.[115]Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants~ voiced and voiceless stops~ voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates. It has three long and three short vowels~ which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.[116] The basic word in Egyptian~ similar to Semitic and Berber~ is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the person. For example~ the triconsonantal skeleton S-Ḏ-M is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is sḏm~ 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun~ suffixes are not added to the verb:[117] sḏm ḥmt~ 'the woman hears'.Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.[118] The word order is predicate–subject in verbal and adjectival sentences~ and subject–predicate in nominal and adverbial sentences.[119] The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.[120] Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n~ but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable~ which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).[121]Hieroglyphic writing dates from c. 3000 BC~ and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word~ a sound~ or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script~ used on stone monuments and in tombs~ that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing~ scribes used a cursive form of writing~ called hieratic~ which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left)~ hieratic was always written from right to left~ usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing~ Demotic~ became the prevalent writing style~ and it is this form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.[123]Around the first century AD~ the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.[124] Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century~ towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded~ knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine[125] and Islamic periods in Egypt~[126] but only in the 1820s~ after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion~ were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered.[127]Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes~ who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices~ libraries (called House of Books)~ laboratories and observatories.[128] Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature~ such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts~ were written in Classical Egyptian~ which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents~ love poetry and tales~ as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period~ the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography~ such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as Sebayt ("instructions") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus~ a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval~ is a famous example.The Story of Sinuhe~ written in Middle Egyptian~ might be the classic of Egyptian literature.[129] Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus~ a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.[130] The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.[131] Towards the end of the New Kingdom~ the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC~ narrative stories and instructions~ such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy~ as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras~ when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.[132]Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members~ and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof~ which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.[133] Ceramics served as household wares for the storage~ preparation~ transport~ and consumption of food~ drink~ and raw materials. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats~ while wooden stools~ beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.[134]The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.[135] Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white~ and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs~ jewelry~ and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity~ at about age 12~ and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children~ while the father provided the family's income.[136]Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps~ while instruments similar to trumpets~ oboes~ and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom~ the Egyptians played on bells~ cymbals~ tambourines~ drums~ and imported lutes and lyres from Asia.[137] The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities~ including games and music. Senet~ a board game where pieces moved according to random chance~ was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen~ which had a circular gaming board. "Hounds and Jackals" also known as 58 holes is another example of board games played in ancient Egypt. The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhat IV that dates to the 13th Dynasty.[138] Juggling and ball games were popular with children~ and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan.[139] The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting~ fishing~ and boating as well.The excavation of the workers' village of Deir el-Medina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world~ which spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organization~ social interactions~ and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail.[140]Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed~ the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer~ supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic~ and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish~ meat~ and fowl could be salted or dried~ and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.[141]The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes~ but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments~ architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.[142]The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood~ and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes~ while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces~ such as those in Malkata and Amarna~ show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people~ birds~ water pools~ deities and geometric designs.[143] Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building~ Djoser's mortuary complex~ include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.[citation needed]The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples~ such as those at Giza~ consist of single~ enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom~ architects added the pylon~ the open courtyard~ and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary~ a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period.[144] The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba~ a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms~ but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.[145] The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia.[146]The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years~ artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom~ following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.[147] These artistic standards—simple lines~ shapes~ and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls~ coffins~ stelae~ and even statues. The Narmer Palette~ for example~ displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.[148] Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance~ ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.[149]Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs~ but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres)~ copper ores (blue and green)~ soot or charcoal (black)~ and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes~ which could be moistened with water when needed.[150]Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle~ royal decrees~ and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art~ such as shabti statues and books of the dead~ which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.[151] During the Middle Kingdom~ wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife~ these models show laborers~ houses~ boats~ and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.[152]Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art~ the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period~ Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris.[153] The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna Period~ where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas.[154] This style~ known as Amarna art~ was quickly abandoned after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.[155]Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However~ the gods were not always viewed as benevolent~ and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy~ but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system.[156] These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.[157]Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation~ and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally~ the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes~ and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.[158] After the New Kingdom~ the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result~ priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.[159]The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects. In addition to the body~ each person had a šwt (shadow)~ a ba (personality or soul)~ a ka (life-force)~ and a name.[160] The heart~ rather than the brain~ was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death~ the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will~ but they required the physical remains (or a substitute~ such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the "blessed dead"~ living on as an akh~ or "effective one". For this to happen~ the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial~ in which the heart was weighed against a "feather of truth." If deemed worthy~ the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.[161] If they were not deemed worthy~ their heart was eaten by Ammit the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe.[citation needed]The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification~ performing burial ceremonies~ and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.[151] Before the Old Kingdom~ bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid~ desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor~ who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification~ which involved removing the internal organs~ wrapping the body in linen~ and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty~ some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.[162]By the New Kingdom~ the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs~ removing the brain through the nose~ and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras~ while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy~ which was decorated.[163]Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items~ but all burials~ regardless of social status~ included goods for the deceased. Funerary texts were often included in the grave~ and~ beginning in the New Kingdom~ so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.[164] Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial~ living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.[165]The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion~ and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the ancient Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes~ such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases~ such as the fortress at Sile~ which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom~ a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant.[166]Typical military equipment included bows and arrows~ spears~ and round-topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom~ the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle~ spears were tipped with a bronze point~ and the khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.[167] The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs~ such as Seqenenre Tao II and his sons~ did do so.[168] However~ it has also been argued that "kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders~ fighting alongside their troops."[169] Soldiers were recruited from the general population~ but during~ and especially after~ the New Kingdom~ mercenaries from Nubia~ Kush~ and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.[170]In technology~ medicine~ and mathematics~ ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism~ as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600 BC)~ is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.Even before the Old Kingdom~ the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience~ which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica~ small amounts of lime and soda~ and a colorant~ typically copper.[171] The material was used to make beads~ tiles~ figurines~ and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience~ but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core~ which was then fired. By a related technique~ the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian blue~ also called blue frit~ which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica~ copper~ lime~ and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.[172]The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill~ but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.[173] It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots~ which they melted and finished. However~ they did have technical expertise in making objects~ as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced~ including yellow~ red~ green~ blue~ purple~ and white~ and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.[174]The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites~ which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints~ and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth~ leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).[175]The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars~ which promoted periodontal disease.[176] Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls~ the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.[177] Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women~ but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.[e]Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills~ and some~ such as Imhotep~ remained famous long after their deaths.[178] Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians~ with some treating only the head or the stomach~ while others were eye-doctors and dentists.[179] Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or "House of Life" institution~ most notably those headquartered in Per-Bastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Saïs in the Late period. Medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy~ injuries~ and practical treatments.[180]Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat~ white linen~ sutures~ nets~ pads~ and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection~[181] while opium~ thyme~ and belladona were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess Isis. Moldy bread~ honey~ and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns.[182] Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds~ set broken bones~ and amputated diseased limbs~ but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.[183]Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000 BC. The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats.[5] A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks "sewn" together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of New York University~[184] woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together~[5] and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.[5] Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy~ originally they were all thought to have belonged to him~ but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC~ and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000 BC was 75 feet (23 m) long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh~ perhaps one as early as Hor-Aha.[184]Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together~ using pitch for caulking the seams. The "Khufu ship"~ a 43.6-metre (143 ft) vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC~ is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints.[5]Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean~ especially Byblos (on the coast of modern-day Lebanon)~ and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a "Byblos Ship"~ which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run; however~ by the end of the Old Kingdom~ the term had come to include large seagoing ships~ whatever their destination.[185]In 1977~ an ancient north–south canal was discovered extending from Lake Timsah to the Ballah Lakes.[186] It was dated to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.[186][f]In 2011~ archaeologists from Italy~ the United States~ and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes~ made from papyrus~ coiled in huge bundles.[187] In 2013~ a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port~ dating back about 4500 years~ from the time of King Khufu on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez).[188]The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period~ and show a fully developed numeral system.[g] The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land~ labor~ and grain.[190] Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition~ subtraction~ multiplication~ and division—use fractions~ calculate the areas of rectangles~ triangles~ and circles and compute the volumes of boxes~ columns and pyramids. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry~ and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.[191]Mathematical notation was decimal~ and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred~ the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.[192] Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one~ they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example~ they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this.[193] Some common fractions~ however~ were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.[194]Ancient Egyptian mathematicians knew the Pythagorean theorem as an empirical formula. They were aware~ for example~ that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 3–4–5 ratio.[195] They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:a reasonable approximation of the formula πr2.[196]Estimates of the size of the population range from 1–1.5 million in the 3rd millennium BC to possibly 2–3 million by the 1st millennium BC~ before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium.[197]According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft~ conflicting DNA analysis on recent genetic samples such as the Amarna royal mummies has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.[198]The genetic history of Ancient Egypt remains a developing field~ and is relevant for the understanding of population demographic events connecting Africa and Eurasia. To date~ the amount of genome-wide aDNA analyses on ancient specimens from Egypt and Sudan remain scarce~ although studies on uniparental haplogroups in ancient individuals have been carried out several times~ pointing broadly to affinities with other African and Eurasian groups.[199][200]The currently most advanced full genome analyses was made on three ancient specimens recovered from the Nile River Valley~ Abusir el-Meleq~ Egypt. Two of the individuals were dated to the Pre-Ptolemaic Period (New Kingdom to Late Period)~ and one individual to the Ptolemaic Period~ spanning around 1300 years of Egyptian history. These results point to a genetic continuity of Ancient Egyptians with modern Egyptians. The results further point to a close genetic affinity between ancient Egyptians and Middle Eastern populations~ especially ancient groups from the Levant (Natufian culture).[199][200]Ancient Egyptians also displayed affinities to Nubians to the south of Egypt~ in modern-day Sudan. Archaeological and historical evidence support interactions between Egyptian and Nubian populations more than 5000 years ago~ with socio-political dynamics between Egyptians and Nubians ranging from peaceful coexistence to variably successful attempts of conquest. A study on sixty-six ancient Nubian individuals revealed significant contact with ancient Egyptians~ characterized by the presence of c. 57% Neolithic/Bronze Age Levantine ancestry in these individuals. Such geneflow of Levantine-like ancestry corresponds with archaeological and botanic evidence~ pointing to a Neolithic movement around 7~000 years ago.[199][200]Genetic data on other Northern African specimens~ such as the c. 15~000 year old Iberomaurusian Taforalt man~ but also specimens from the "last Green Sahara" and the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic~ point to the widespread presence of an (Western) Eurasian ancestry component distributed throughout Northern Africa~ the Sahara~ and the Horn of Africa~ having arrived via back migration(s) from the Middle East starting as early as c. 23~000 years ago.[201][202][203][204]Modern Egyptians~ like modern Nubians~ underwent subsequent admixture events~ contributing both "Sub-Saharan" African-like and West Asian-like ancestries~ since the Roman period~ with significance on the African Slave Trade and the Spread of Islam.[199][200]Some scholars~ such as Christopher Ehret~ caution that a wider sampling area is needed and argue that the current data is inconclusive on the origin of ancient Egyptians. They also point out issues with the previously used methodology such as the sampling size~ comparative approach and a "biased interpretation" of the genetic data. They argue in favor for a link between Ancient Egypt and the northern Horn of Africa. This latter view has been attributed to the corresponding archaeological~ genetic~ linguistic and biological anthropological sources of evidence which broadly indicate that the earliest Egyptians and Nubians were the descendants of populations in northeast Africa.[205][206][207][198]The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the Kingdom of Kush and Meroë with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms (hundreds of pyramids (6–30 meters high) were built in Egypt/Sudan)~ as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the Meroitic script.[208] Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa~ other than Egyptian~ and was used from the 2nd century BC until the early 5th century AD.[209] The cult of the goddess Isis~ for example~ became popular in the Roman Empire~ as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.[210] The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus~ Strabo~ and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land~ which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.[211]During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance~ Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam~ but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi.[212] In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries~ European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys~ leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe~ as evident in symbolism like the Eye of Providence and the Great Seal of the United States. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt~ who took~ purchased~ or were given many important antiquities.[213] Napoleon arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's natural history~ which was published in the Description de l'Égypte.[214]In the 20th century~ the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. Since the 2010s~ the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has overseen excavations and the recovery of artifacts.[215]
2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pschent,Pschent - Wikipedia,1583,0.0000,The pschent (/ˈskɛnt/; Greek ψχέντ) was the double crown worn by rulers in ancient Egypt. The ancient Egyptians generally referred to it as sekhemty (sḫm.ty)~ the Two Powerful Ones.[1] It combined the White Hedjet Crown of Upper Egypt and the Red Deshret Crown of Lower Egypt.The Pschent represented the pharaoh's power over all of unified Egypt.[2] It bore two animal emblems: an Egyptian cobra~ known as the uraeus~ ready to strike~ which symbolized the Lower Egyptian goddess Wadjet; and a vulture representing the Upper Egyptian tutelary goddess Nekhbet. These were fastened to the front of the Pschent and referred to as the Two Ladies.The invention of the Pschent is generally attributed to the First Dynasty pharaoh Menes~ but the first one known to wear a Double Crown was the First Dynasty pharaoh Djet: a rock inscription shows his Horus wearing it.[3]The king list on the Palermo Stone~ which begins with the names of Lower Egyptian pharaohs (nowadays thought to have been mythological demigods)~ shown wearing the Red Crown~ marks the unification of the country by giving the Pschent to all First Dynasty and later pharaohs.[4] The Cairo fragment~ on the other hand~ shows these prehistoric rulers wearing the Pschent.[5]As is the case with the Deshret and the Hedjet Crowns~ no Pschent is currently known to have survived. It is known only from statuary~ depictions~ inscriptions~ and ancient tales.Among the deities sometimes depicted wearing the Double Crown are Horus[6] and Atum or Ra both representing the pharaoh or having a special relationship to the pharaoh.[7]
3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshret,Deshret - Wikipedia,4557,0.0000,Deshret (Ancient Egyptian: 𓂧𓈙𓂋𓏏𓋔~ romanized: dašrat~ lit. 'Red One') was the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. When combined with the Hedjet (White Crown) of Upper Egypt~ it forms the Pschent (Double Crown)~ in ancient Egyptian called the sekhemti.The Red Crown in Egyptian language hieroglyphs eventually was used as the vertical letter "n". The original "n" hieroglyph from the Predynastic Period and the Old Kingdom was the sign depicting ripples of water.The word Deshret also referred to the desert Red Land on either side of Kemet (Black Land)~ the fertile Nile river basin.In mythology~ the earth deity Geb~ original ruler of Egypt~ invested Horus with the rule over Lower Egypt.[1] The Egyptian pharaohs~ who saw themselves as successors of Horus~ wore the deshret to symbolize their authority over Lower Egypt.[2] Other deities wore the deshret too~ or were identified with it~ such as the protective serpent goddess Wadjet and the creator-goddess of Sais~ Neith~ who often is shown wearing the Red Crown.[3]The Red Crown would later be combined with the White Crown of Upper Egypt to form the Double Crown~ symbolizing the rule over the whole country~ "The Two Lands" as the Egyptians expressed it.[4]No Red Crown has been found. Several ancient representations indicate it was woven like a basket from plant fiber such as grass~ straw~ flax~ palm leaf~ or reed.The Red Crown frequently is mentioned in texts and depicted in reliefs and statues. An early example is the depiction of the victorious pharaoh wearing the deshret on the Narmer Palette. A label from the reign of Djer records a royal visit to the shrine of the Deshret which may have been located at Buto in the Nile delta.[5]The fact that no crown has ever been found buried with any of the pharaohs~ even in relatively intact tombs~ might suggest that it was passed from one reign to the next~ much as in present-day monarchies.Toby Wilkinson has cited the iconography on rock art in the Eastern Desert region as depicting what he interpreted to be among the earliest representations of the royal crowns and suggested the Red Crown could have originated in the southern Nile Valley.[6]Deshret~ the ancient Egyptian Red Crown~ is one of the oldest Egyptian hieroglyphs. As an iconographic element~ it is used on the famous palette of Pharaoh Narmer as the "Red Crown of the Delta"~ the Delta being Lower Egypt.The first usage of the Red Crown was in iconography as the symbol for Lower Egypt with the Nile Delta~ horizontal letter 'n'~ Gardiner no. 35~Later it came to be used in the Egyptian language as an alphabetic uniliteral~ vertical form for letter "n" as a phoneme or preposition. It became functional in running hieroglyphic texts~ where either the horizontal or vertical form preposition satisfied space requirements.Both the vertical and horizontal forms are prepositional equivalents~ with the horizontal letter n~ the N-water ripple (n hieroglyph) being more common~ as well as more common to form parts of Egyptian language words requiring the phoneme 'n'.One old use of the red crown hieroglyph is to make the word: 'in'!~ (formerly an-(a-with dot)-(the "vertical feather" hieroglyph a~ plus the red crown). Egyptian "in" is used at the beginning of a text and translates as: Behold!~ or Lo!~ and is an emphatic.The Red Crown is also used as a determinative~ most notably in the word for deshret. It is also used in other words or names of gods.In the 198 BC Rosetta Stone~ the 'Red Crown' as hieroglyph has the usage mostly of the vertical form of the preposition "n". In running text~ word endings are not always at the end of hieroglyph blocks; when they are at the end~ a simple transition to start the next block is a vertical separator~ in this case the preposition~ vertical n~ (thus a space saver).Since the start of the next hieroglyphic block could also be started with a horizontal "n" at the bottom of the previous block~ it should be thought that the vertical "n" is also chosen for a visual effect; in other words~ it visually spreads out the running text of words~ instead of piling horizontal prepositions in a more tight text. Visually it is also a hieroglyph that takes up more 'space'-(versus a straight-line type for the horizontal water ripple); so it may have a dual purpose of a less compact text~ and a better segue-transition to the next words.The Red Crown hieroglyph is used 35 times in the Rosetta Stone; only 4 times is it used as a non-preposition. It averages once per line usage in the 36 line Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)-(Rosetta Stone).
4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Egypt,Lower Egypt - Wikipedia,4585,0.0000,Lower Egypt (Arabic: مصر السفلى Miṣr as-Suflā; Coptic: ⲧⲥⲁϧⲏⲧ~ romanized: Tsakhet) is the northernmost region of Egypt~ which consists of the fertile Nile Delta between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea~ from El Aiyat~ south of modern-day Cairo~ and Dahshur. Historically~ the Nile River split into seven branches of the delta in Lower Egypt. Lower Egypt was divided into nomes and began to advance as a civilization after 3600 BC.[1] Today~ it contains two major channels that flow through the delta of the Nile River – Mahmoudiyah Canal (ancient Agathos Daimon) and Muways Canal (Arabic: بحر موَيس~ "waterway of Moses").In Ancient Egyptian~ Lower Egypt was known as mḥw which means "north".[2] Later on~ during Antiquity and the Middle Ages~ Greeks and Romans called it Κάτω Αἴγυπτος or Aegyptus Inferior both meaning "Lower Egypt"~ but Copts carried on using the old name related to the north – Tsakhet (Coptic: ⲧⲥⲁϧⲏⲧ) or Psanemhit (Coptic: ⲡⲥⲁⲛⲉⲙϩⲓⲧ) meaning the "Northern part". It was further divided into a number of regions or nomes (Coptic: ⲡⲧⲟϣ~ romanized: ptosh) – Niphaiat (Coptic: ⲛⲓⲫⲁⲓⲁⲧ~ lit. 'Libyan (nome)'~ Ancient Greek: Μαρεωτης) in the west~ Tiarabia (Coptic: ϯⲁⲣⲁⲃⲓⲁ~ lit. 'Arabia') in the east~ Nimeshshoti (Coptic: ⲛⲓⲙⲉϣϣⲟϯ~ lit. 'fields') in the north-east and Bashmur (Bashmuric Coptic: ⲡⲥⲁⲙⲏⲣ~ lit. 'sand shore') in the north. Champollion adds another region in the middle of the Delta which he calls Petmour (Coptic: ⲡⲉⲧⲙⲟⲩⲣ~ lit. 'the one which bounds~ girds')[3] based on Ancient Greek: Πτιμυρις mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium~ but it is unclear if this is a separate region or just a Greek rendering of the name Bashmur.[4]After the Muslim conquest~ the middle part of the Delta was called al-Rif (Arabic: الريف) which means "countryside~ rural area" and which is derived from Ancient Egyptianr-pr~ "temple"~ because the rural areas were administered by them.[5] The eastern part roughly comprising the ancient Tiarabia was called al-Hawf (Arabic: الهوف) meaning "edge~ fringe".[6]Today~ there are two principal channels that the Nile takes through the river delta: one in the west at Rashid and one in the east at Damietta.The delta region is well watered~ crisscrossed by channels and canals.Owing primarily to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea~ the climate in Lower Egypt is milder than that of Upper Egypt~ the southern portion of the country. Temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is more abundant in Lower Egypt.It was divided into twenty districts called nomes~ the first of which was at el-Lisht. Because Lower Egypt was mostly undeveloped scrubland~ filled with all types of plant life such as grasses and herbs~ the organization of the nomes underwent several changes.The capital of Lower Egypt was Memphis. Its patron goddess was the goddess Wadjet~ depicted as a cobra. Lower Egypt was represented by the Red Crown Deshret~ and its symbols were the papyrus and the bee. After unification~ the patron deities of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were represented together as the Two Ladies~ Wadjet and Nekhbet (depicted as a vulture)~ to protect all of the ancient Egyptians.By approximately 3600 BC~ Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile River had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.[7] Shortly after 3600 BC~ Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization.[1] A new and distinctive pottery~ which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant~ appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time.[1] The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks~ and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time.[1]Concurrent with these cultural advances~ a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River~ or Upper Egypt~ occurred. At the same time~ the societies of the Nile Delta~ or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process.[1] Warfare between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt occurred often.[1] During his reign in Upper Egypt~ King Narmer defeated his enemies in the Delta and merged the kingdoms of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt under his single rule.[8]The Palermo stone~ a royal annal written in the mid Fifth Dynasty (c. 2490 BC – c. 2350 BC) records a number of kings reigning over Lower Egypt before Narmer. These are completely unattested outside these inscriptions:In contrast~ the following kings are attested through archeological finds from Sinai and Lower Egypt: Double Falcon~ Crocodile.
5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedjet,Hedjet - Wikipedia,3284,0.0000,Hedjet (Ancient Egyptian: 𓌉𓏏𓋑~ romanized: ḥuḏat~ lit. 'White One') is the White Crown of pharaonic Upper Egypt. After the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt~ it was combined with the Deshret~ the Red Crown of Lower Egypt~ to form the Pschent~ the double crown of Egypt. The symbol sometimes used for the White Crown was the vulture goddess Nekhbet shown next to the head of the cobra goddess Wadjet~ the uraeus on the Pschent.[1]The white crown~ along with the red crown~ has a long history with each of their respective representations going back into the Predynastic Period~ indicating that kingship had been the base of Egyptian society for some time. The earliest image of the hedjet was thought to have been in the Qustul in Nubia. According to Jane Roy~ "At the time of Williams’ argument~ the Qustul cemetery and the ‘royal’ iconography found there was dated to the Naqada IIIA period~ thus antedating royal cemeteries in Egypt of the Naqada IIIB phase. New evidence from Abydos~ however~ particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tomb U-j~ dating to Naqada IIIA has shown that this iconography appears earlier in Egypt".[2]Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns~ Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and A-Group Nubia. He further elaborated that "Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and A-Group Nubia~ and not in the Delta cultures~ where the direct Western Asian contact was made~ [which] further vitiates the Mesopotamian-influence argument".[3] According to David Wengrow~ the A-Group polity of the late 4th millenninum BCE is poorly understood since most of the archaeological remains are submerged underneath Lake Nasser.[4]Stan Hendrick~ John Coleman Darnell and Maria Gatto in 2012 excavated petroglyphic engravings from Nag el-Hamdulab in Aswan~ the extreme southern region of Egypt that borders the Sudan~ which featured representations of boat procession~ solar symbolism and the earliest depiction of the white crown with an estimated dating range between 3200BC and 3100BC.[5]Nekhbet~ the tutelary goddess of Nekhebet (modern el Kab) near Hierakonpolis~ was depicted as a woman~ sometimes with the head of a vulture~ wearing the white crown.[6] The falcon god Horus of Hierakonpolis (Egyptian: Nekhen) was generally shown wearing a white crown.[7] A famous depiction of the white crown is on the Narmer palette found at Hierakonpolis in which the king of the South wearing the hedjet is shown triumphing over his northern enemies. The kings of the united Egypt saw themselves as successors of Horus. Vases from the reign of Khasekhemwy show the king as Horus wearing the white crown.[8]As with the deshret (red crown)~ no example of the white crown has been found. It is unknown how it was constructed and what materials were used. Felt or leather have been suggested~ but this is purely speculative. Like the deshret~ the hedjet may have been woven like a basket from plant fiber such as grass~ straw~ flax~ palm leaf~ or reed. The fact that no crown has ever been found~ even in relatively intact royal tombs such as that of Tutankhamun~ suggests the crowns may have been passed from one monarch to the next~ much as in present-day monarchies.

It thus consists of the entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser (formed by the Aswan High Dam).[2]In ancient Egypt~ Upper Egypt was known as tꜣ šmꜣw~[3] literally "the Land of Reeds" or "the Sedgeland"~ named for the sedges that grow there.[4]In Arabic~ the region is called Sa'id or Sahid~ from صعيد meaning "uplands"~ from the root صعد meaning to go up~ ascend~ or rise. Inhabitants of Upper Egypt are known as Sa'idis and they generally speak Sai'idi Egyptian Arabic.Upper Egypt is between the Cataracts of the Nile beyond modern-day Aswan~ downriver (northward) to the area of El-Ayait~[5] which places modern-day Cairo in Lower Egypt. The northern (downriver) part of Upper Egypt~ between Sohag and El-Ayait~ is also known as Middle Egypt.It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during the Naqada III period (c. 3200–3000 BC)~ and its subsequent unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period.[6] Upper and Lower Egypt became intertwined in the symbolism of pharaonic sovereignty such as the Pschent double crown.[7] Upper Egypt remained as a historical region even after the classical period.The main city of prehistoric Upper Egypt was Nekhen.[8] The patron deity was the goddess Nekhbet~ depicted as a vulture.[9]By approximately 3600 BC~ Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.[10] Shortly thereafter~ Egypt began to grow and increase in complexity.[11] A new and distinctive pottery appeared~ related to the Levantine ceramics~ and copper implements and ornaments became common.[11] Mesopotamian building techniques became popular~ using sun-dried adobe bricks in arches and decorative recessed walls.[11]In Upper Egypt~ the predynastic Badari culture was followed by the Naqada culture (Amratian)~[12] closely related to the Lower Nubian;[13][14][15][16] other northeast African populations[17] and some tropical African groups.[18][19] Also~ the proto-dynastic kings emerged from the Naqada region.[20] Excavations at Hierakonpolis (Upper Egypt) found archaeological evidence of ritual masks similar to those used further south of Egypt~ and obsidian linked to Ethiopian quarry sites.[21]Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns~ Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and A-Group Lower Nubia. He further elaborated that "Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and A-Group Lower Nubia~ and not in the Delta cultures~ where the direct Western Asian contact was made~ further vititates the Mesopotamian-influence argument".[22]Similarly~ Christopher Ehret~ historian and linguist~ stated that the cultural practice of sacral chiefship and kingship which emerged in Upper Egypt in the fourth millennium had originated centuries earlier in Nubia and the Middle Nile south of Egypt. He based this judgement on supporting~ archaeological and comparative ethnographic evidence.[23]According to bioarchaeologist Nancy Lovell~ the morphology of ancient Egyptian skeletons gives strong evidence that "In general~ the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas" but exhibited local variation in an African context.[24]S. O. Y. Keita~ a biological anthropologist also reviewed studies on the biological affinities of the Ancient Egyptian population and characterised the skeletal morphologies of predynastic southern Egyptians as a "Saharo-tropical African variant". Keita had also added that whilst Egyptian society became more socially complex and biologically varied~ the "ethnicity of the Niloto-Saharo-Sudanese origins did not change".[25]These cultural advances paralleled the political unification of towns of the upper Nile River~ or Upper Egypt~ while the same occurred in the societies of the Nile Delta~ or Lower Egypt.[11] This led to warfare between the two new kingdoms.[11] During his reign in Upper Egypt~ King Narmer defeated his enemies on the delta and became sole ruler of the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt~[26] a sovereignty which endured throughout Dynastic Egypt.In royal symbolism~ Upper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown Hedjet~ the flowering lotus~ and the sedge. Its patron deity~ Nekhbet~ was depicted by the vulture. After unification~ the patron deities of Upper and Lower Egypt were represented together as the Two Ladies~ to protect all of the ancient Egyptians~ just as the two crowns were combined into a single pharaonic diadem.Several dynasties of southern or Upper Egyptian origin~ which included the 11th~ 12th~ 17th~ 18th and 25th dynasties~ reunified and reinvigorated pharaonic Egypt after periods of fragmentation.[27]For most of Egypt's ancient history~ Thebes was the administrative center of Upper Egypt. After its devastation by the Assyrians~ the importance of Egypt declined. Under the dynasty of the Ptolemies~ Ptolemais Hermiou took over the role of the capital city of Upper Egypt.[28]A 2005 study on Theban nobles had found that the mummified remains had a histology which "indicated notably dark skin".[29]In the eleventh century~ large numbers of pastoralists~ known as Hilalians~ fled Upper Egypt and moved westward into Libya and as far as Tunis.[30] It is believed that degraded grazing conditions in Upper Egypt~ associated with the beginning of the Medieval Warm Period~ were the root cause of the migration.[31]In the twentieth-century Egypt~ the title Prince of the Sa'id (meaning Prince of Upper Egypt) was used by the heir apparent to the Egyptian throne.[Note 1]Although the Kingdom of Egypt was abolished after the Egyptian revolution of 1952~ the title continues to be used by Muhammad Ali~ Prince of the Sa'id.The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence):Nowadays~ Upper Egypt forms part of these 7 governorates:Large cities located in Upper Egypt:
7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_royal_titulary,Ancient Egyptian royal titulary - Wikipedia,5283,0.0000,The royal titulary or royal protocol is the standard naming convention taken by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. It symbolised worldly power and holy might~ also acting as a sort of mission statement for the duration of a monarch's reign (although sometimes it even changed during the reign).The full titulary~ consisting of five names~ did not come into standard usage until the Middle Kingdom but remained in use as late as the Roman Empire.In order that the pharaoh~ who held divine office~ could be linked to the people and the gods~ special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. These titles also served to demonstrate one's qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name.[1][2] This name identified the figure as a representative of the god Horus.[3] The Nebty name was the second part of the royal titular[4][3] of Upper and Lower Egypt.[2] This name placed the king under the protection of two female deities~ Nekhbet and Wadjet[4] and began sometime towards the end of the First Dynasty as a reference to "The one who belongs to Upper and Lower Egypt"~ along with mention of the Two Ladies.[2] Beginning sometime in the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt~ the Gold Falcon name (sometimes called the Horus of Gold) was created.[5] The last two names of the king~ the prenomen and the nomen~ were generally depicted within the circular~ roped cartouche of the king (eventually the cartouche would contain all royal names~ including the queen and the royal children) and were known as the Throne name and the Son of Re name.[5]𓅃𓊁The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name~ originating in prehistoric Egypt. Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title.[6]The Horus name was usually written in a serekh~ a representation of a palace façade. The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. Typically an image of the falcon god Horus was perched on top of or beside it.[6]At least one Egyptian ruler~ the Second Dynasty pharaoh Seth-Peribsen~ used an image of the god Set instead of Horus~ perhaps signifying an internal religious division within the country. He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy~ who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. Thereafter~ the image of Horus always appeared alongside the name of the pharaoh.[6]By the time of the New Kingdom~ the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh.The Nebty name (lit. "two ladies") was associated with the so-called "heraldic" goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt:The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet~ though it only became a fully independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty.This particular name was not typically framed by a cartouche or serekh~ but always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets~ the dual noun "nebty".Also known as the Golden Horus name~ this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold.The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over his uncle Set~ as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was "superior to his foes". Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity~ so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name.Similar to the Nebty name~ this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh.The pharaoh's throne name~ the first of the two names written inside a cartouche~ usually accompanied the title nsw-bity (nsw(t)-bjt(j))~ traditionally interpreted as "[He] of sedge [and] bee" and often translated for convenience as "King of Upper and of Lower Egypt". (The sedge and the bee symbolised Upper and Lower Egypt~ respectively~[7][8] although recent research has thrown this interpretation into doubt.[9][10])The epithet nb tꜣwy~ "Lord of the Two Lands"~ referring to the valley and delta regions of Egypt~ often occurs as well.[clarification needed]This was the name given at birth. The name itself was preceded by the title "Son of Ra"~ written with the hieroglyph of a duck (za)~ a homonym for the word meaning "son" (za)~ adjacent to an image of the sun~ a hieroglyph for the chief solar deity Ra. It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. For women who became pharaoh~ the preceding title was interpreted as "daughter" also.Modern historians typically refer to the ancient kings of Egypt by this name~ adding ordinals (e.g. "II"~ "III") to distinguish between different individuals bearing the same name.In the Middle Kingdom~ the full titulary was sometimes written in a single cartouche~ as in this example from Senusret I~ from Beni Hasan.The full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut~ providing a guide to pronunciation and its equivalent meaning and showing the differences since this pharaoh is a woman~ is as follows~The full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III~ providing a guide to pronunciation and its equivalent meaning~ is as follows
8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer,Narmer - Wikipedia,19767,0.0000,Narmer (Ancient Egyptian: nꜥr-mr~ may mean "painful catfish"~ "stinging catfish"~ "harsh catfish"~ or "fierce catfish;"[1][2][3]) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period~ whose reign began at a date estimated to fall in the range 3273–2987 BC.[4] He was the successor to the Protodynastic king Ka. Many scholars consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty~ and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. He also had a prominently noticeable presence in Canaan~ compared to his predecessors and successors. Neithhotep is thought to be his queen consort or his daughter.A majority of Egyptologists believe that Narmer was the same person as Menes.[a][6][7][8]Although highly interrelated~ the questions of "who was Menes?" and "who unified Egypt?" are actually two separate issues. Narmer is often credited with the unification of Egypt by means of the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt. Menes is traditionally considered the first king/pharaoh of Ancient Egypt~ and is identified by the majority of Egyptologists as the same person as Narmer – although a vigorous debate also proposes identification with Hor-Aha~ Narmer's successor~ as a primary alternative.[b]The issue is confusing because "Narmer" is a Horus name while "Menes" is a Sedge and Bee name (personal or birth name). All of the King Lists which began to appear in the New Kingdom era list the personal names of the kings~ and almost all begin with Menes~ or begin with divine and/or semi-divine rulers~ with Menes as the first "human king". The difficulty is aligning the contemporary archaeological evidence which lists Horus Names with the King Lists that list personal names.Two documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively Hor-Aha was Menes. The first is the "Naqada Label" found at the site of Naqada~ in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep~ often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha.[10] The label shows a serekh of Hor-Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name "Menes". The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a serekh of Narmer and the chessboard symbol~ "mn"~ which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor-Aha being Menes~ but in neither case is the argument conclusive.[c]The second document~ the seal impression from Abydos~ shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign (mn)~ together with its phonetic complement~ the n sign~ which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written~ again representing the name "Menes". At first glance~ this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes.[14] However~ based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions~ which contain the name of one or more princes~ the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes~ hence Menes was Narmer's successor~ Hor-Aha~ and thus Hor-Aha was Menes.[15] This was refuted by Cervelló-Autuori 2005~ pp. 42–45; but opinions still vary~ and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory.[16]Two necropolis sealings~ found in 1985 and 1991 in Abydos (Umm el-Qa'ab)~ in or near the tombs of Den[18] and Qa'a~[19] show Narmer as the first king on each list~ followed by Hor-Aha. The Qa'a sealing lists all eight of the kings of what scholars now call the First Dynasty in the correct order~ starting with Narmer. These necropolis sealings are strong evidence that Narmer was the first king of the First Dynasty~ hence the same person as Menes.[20]The complete spelling of Narmer's name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish (nꜥr)[d] and a chisel (mr)~ hence the reading "Narmer" (using the rebus principle). This word is sometimes translated as "raging catfish".[23] However~ there is no consensus on this reading. Other translations of the adjective before "catfish" include "angry"~ "fighting"~ "fierce"~ "painful"~ "furious"~ "bad"~ "evil"~ "biting"~ "menacing"~ and "stinging".[1][2][3] Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include "catfish" in the name at all~[24][25][26] but these approaches have not been generally accepted.Rather than incorporating both hieroglyphs~ Narmer's name is often shown in an abbreviated form with just the catfish symbol~ sometimes stylized~ even~ in some cases~ represented by just a horizontal line.[27] This simplified spelling appears to be related to the formality of the context. In every case that a serekh is shown on a work of stone or an official seal impression~ it has both symbols. But~ in most cases~ where the name is shown on a piece of pottery or a rock inscription~ just the catfish~ or a simplified version of it appears.Two alternative spellings of Narmer's name have also been found. On a mud sealing from Tarkhan~ the symbol for the ṯꜣj-bird (Gardiner sign G47 "duckling") has been added to the two symbols for "Narmer" within the serekh. This has been interpreted as meaning "Narmer the masculine";[28] however~ according to Ilona Regulski~[29] "The third sign (the [ṯꜣj]-bird) is not an integral part of the royal name since it occurs so infrequently." Godron[30] suggested that the extra sign is not part of the name~ but was put inside the serekh for compositional convenience.In addition~ two necropolis seals from Abydos show the name in a unique way: While the chisel is shown conventionally where the catfish would be expected~ there is a symbol that has been interpreted by several scholars as an animal skin.[31] According to Dreyer~ it is probably a catfish with a bull's tail~ similar to the image of Narmer on the Narmer Palette in which he is shown wearing a bull's tail as a symbol of power.[32]The date commonly given for the beginning of Narmer's reign is c. 3100 BC.[33][34] Other mainstream estimates~ using both the historical method and radiocarbon dating~ are in the range c. 3273–2987 BC.[e]The famous Narmer Palette~ discovered by James E. Quibell in the 1897–1898 season at Hierakonpolis~[35] shows Narmer wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side of the palette~ and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other side~ giving rise to the theory that Narmer unified the two lands.[36] Since its discovery~ however~ it has been debated whether the Narmer Palette represents an actual historic event or is purely symbolic.[f] Of course~ the Narmer Palette could represent an actual historical event while at the same time having a symbolic significance.In 1993~ Günter Dreyer discovered a "year label" of Narmer at Abydos~ depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette. In the First Dynasty~ years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year. A "year label" was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king~ a description or representation of the event that identified the year~ and a description of the attached goods. This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event.[37] Support for this conclusion (in addition to Dreyer) includes Wilkinson[38] and Davies & Friedman.[39] Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists~ there are exceptions including Baines[40] and Wengrow.[41]Archaeological evidence suggests that Egypt was at least partially unified during the reigns of Ka and Iry-Hor (Narmer's immediate predecessors)~ and perhaps as early as Scorpion I. Tax collection is probably documented for Ka[44] and Iry-Hor.[45] The evidence for a role for Scorpion I in Lower Egypt comes from his tomb Uj in Abydos (Upper Egypt)~ where labels were found identifying goods from Lower Egypt.[46] These are not tax documents~ however~ so they are probably indications of trade rather than subjugation. There is a substantial difference in the quantity and distribution of inscriptions with the names of those earlier kings in Lower Egypt and Canaan (which was reached through Lower Egypt)~ compared to the inscriptions of Narmer. Ka's inscriptions have been found in three sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.[47] Iry-Hor inscriptions have also been found in two sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.[47][48] This must be compared to Narmer~ whose serekhs have been found in ten sites in Lower Egypt and nine sites in Canaan (see discussion in "Tomb and Artefacts" section). This demonstrates a qualitative difference between Narmer's role in Lower Egypt compared to his two immediate predecessors. There is no evidence in Lower Egypt of any Upper Egyptian king's presence before Iry-Hor. The archaeological evidence suggest that the unification began before Narmer~ but was completed by him through the conquest of a polity in the north-west Delta as depicted on the Narmer Palette.[49]The importance that Narmer attached to his "unification" of Egypt is shown by the fact that it is commemorated not only on the Narmer Palette~ but on a cylinder seal~[50] the Narmer Year Label~[37] and the Narmer Boxes;[51] and the consequences of the event are commemorated on the Narmer Macehead.[52] The importance of the unification to ancient Egyptians is shown by the fact that Narmer is shown as the first king on the two necropolis seals~ and under the name Menes~ the first king in the later King Lists. Although there is archaeological evidence of a few kings before Narmer~ none of them are mentioned in any of those sources. It can be accurately said that from the point of view of Ancient Egyptians~ history began with Narmer and the unification of Egypt~ and that everything before him was relegated to the realm of myth.According to Manetho (quoted in Eusebius (Fr. 7(a)))~ "Menes made a foreign expedition and won renown." If this is correct (and assuming it refers to Narmer)~ it was undoubtedly to the land of Canaan where Narmer's serekh has been identified at nine different sites. An Egyptian presence in Canaan predates Narmer~ but after about 200 years of active presence in Canaan~[53] Egyptian presence peaked during Narmer's reign and quickly declined afterwards. The relationship between Egypt and Canaan "began around the end of the fifth millennium and apparently came to an end sometime during the Second Dynasty when it ceased altogether."[54] It peaked during Dynasty 0 through the reign of Narmer.[55] Dating to this period are 33 Egyptian serekhs found in Canaan~[56] among which 20 have been attributed to Narmer. Prior to Narmer~ only one serekh of Ka and one inscription with Iry-Hor's name have been found in Canaan.[57] The serekhs earlier than Iry-Hor are either generic serekhs that do not refer to a specific king~ or are for kings not attested in Abydos.[55] Indicative of the decline of Egyptian presence in the region after Narmer~ only one serekh attributed to his successor~ Hor-Aha~ has been found in Canaan.[55] Even this one example is questionable~ Wilkinson does not believe there are any serekhs of Hor-Aha outside Egypt[58] and very few serekhs of kings for the rest of the first two dynasties have been found in Canaan.[59]The Egyptian presence in Canaan is best demonstrated by the presence of pottery made from Egyptian Nile clay and found in Canaan~[g] as well as pottery made from local clay~ but in the Egyptian style. The latter suggests the existence of Egyptian colonies rather than just trade.[61]The nature of Egypt's role in Canaan has been vigorously debated~ between scholars who suggest a military invasion[62] and others proposing that only trade and colonization were involved. Although the latter has gained predominance~[61][63] the presence of fortifications at Tell es-Sakan dating to Dynasty 0 through early Dynasty 1 period~ and built almost entirely using an Egyptian style of construction~ demonstrate that there must have also been some kind of Egyptian military presence.[64]Regardless of the nature of Egypt's presence in Canaan~ control of trade to (and through) Canaan was important to Ancient Egypt. Narmer probably did not establish Egypt's initial influence in Canaan by a military invasion~ but a military campaign by Narmer to re-assert Egyptian authority~ or to increase its sphere of influence in the region~ is certainly plausible. In addition to the quote by Manetho~ and the large number of Narmer serekhs found in Canaan~ a recent reconstruction of a box of Narmer's by Dreyer may have commemorated a military campaign in Canaan.[65] It may also represent just the presentation of tribute to Narmer by Canaanites.[65]Narmer and Hor-Aha's names were both found in what is believed to be Neithhotep's tomb~ which led Egyptologists to conclude that she was Narmer's queen and mother of Hor-Aha.[66] Neithhotep's name means "Neith is satisfied". This suggests that she was a princess of Lower Egypt (based on the fact that Neith is the patron goddess of Sais in the Western Delta~ exactly the area Narmer conquered to complete the unification of Egypt)~ and that this was a marriage to consolidate the two regions of Egypt.[66] The fact that her tomb is in Naqada~ in Upper Egypt~ has led some to the conclusion that she was a descendant of the predynastic rulers of Naqada who ruled prior to its incorporation into a united Upper Egypt.[67] It has also been suggested that the Narmer Macehead commemorates this wedding.[68] However~ the discovery in 2012 of rock inscriptions in Sinai by Pierre Tallet[69] raise questions about whether she was really Narmer's wife.[h] Neithhotep is probably the earliest non-mythical woman in history whose name is known to us today.[71]Narmer's tomb in Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt consists of two joined chambers (B17 and B18)~ lined in mud brick. Although both Émile Amélineau and Petrie excavated tombs B17 and B18~ it was only in 1964 that Kaiser identified them as being Narmer's.[72][i] Narmer's tomb is located next to the tombs of Ka~ who likely ruled Upper Egypt just before Narmer~ and Hor-Aha~ who was his immediate successor.[j]As the tomb dates back more than 5~000 years~ and has been pillaged~ repeatedly~ from antiquity to modern times~ it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it. Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm el-Qa'ab~ many articles of Narmer's were found in other graves~ and objects of other kings were recovered in Narmer's grave. However~ Flinders Petrie during the period 1899–1903~[75][76] and~ starting in the 1970s~ the German Archaeological Institute (DAI)[k] have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their re-excavation of the tombs of Umm el-Qa'ab.Despite the chaotic condition of the cemetery~ inscriptions on both wood and bone~ seal impressions~ as well as dozens of flint arrowheads were found. (Petrie says with dismay that "hundreds" of arrowheads were discovered by "the French"~ presumably Amélineau. What happened to them is not clear~ but none ended up in the Cairo Museum.[77]) Flint knives and a fragment of an ebony chair leg were also discovered in Narmer's tomb~ all of which might be part of the original funerary assemblage. The flint knives and fragment of a chair leg were not included in any of Petrie's publications~ but are now at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (University College London)~ registration numbers UC35679~ UC52786~ and UC35682. According to Dreyer~[32] these arrowheads are probably from the tomb of Djer~ where similar arrowheads were found.[78]It is likely that all of the kings of Ancient Egypt buried in Umm el-Qa'ab had funerary enclosures in Abydos' northern cemetery~ near the cultivation line. These were characterized by large mud brick walls that enclosed space in which funerary ceremonies are believed to have taken place. Eight enclosures have been excavated~ two of which have not been definitely identified.[79][80] While it has yet to be confirmed~ one of these unidentified funerary enclosures may have belonged to Narmer.[l]Narmer is well attested throughout Egypt~ southern Canaan and Sinai: altogether 98 inscriptions at 26 sites.[m] At Abydos and Hierakonpolis Narmer's name appears both within a serekh and without reference to a serekh. At every other site except Coptos~ Narmer's name appears in a serekh. In Egypt~ his name has been found at 17 sites:During Narmer's reign~ Egypt had an active economic presence in southern Canaan. Pottery sherds have been discovered at several sites~ both from pots made in Egypt and imported to Canaan and others made in the Egyptian style out of local materials. Twenty serekhs have been found in Canaan that may belong to Narmer~ but seven of those are uncertain or controversial. These serekhs came from eight different sites: Tel Arad~[111][112] En Besor (Ein HaBesor)~[113][114] Tel es-Sakan~[115][116] Nahal Tillah (Halif Terrace)~[117] Tel Erani (Tel Gat)~[118][119] Small Tel Malhata~[120][121] Tel Ma'ahaz~[122] and Tel Lod~[123]Narmer's serekh~ along with those of other Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings~ has been found at the Wadi 'Ameyra in the southern Sinai~ where inscriptions commemorate Egyptian mining expeditions to the area.[124][125]First recorded at the end of the 19th century~ an important series of rock carvings at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan was rediscovered in 2009~ and its importance only realized then.[126][127][128] Among the many inscriptions~ tableau 7a shows a man wearing a headdress similar to the White Crown of Upper Egypt and carrying a scepter. He is followed by a man with a fan. He is then preceded by two men with standards~ and accompanied by a dog. Apart from the dog motif~ this scene is similar to scenes on the Scorpion Macehead and the recto of the Narmer Palette. The man~ equipped with pharaonic regalia (the crown and scepter)~ can clearly be identified as a king. Although no name appears in the tableau~ Darnell[127] attributes it to Narmer~ based on the iconography~ and suggests that it might represent an actual visit to the region by Narmer for a "Following of Horus" ritual. In an interview in 2012~ Gatto[129] also describes the king in the inscription as Narmer. However~ Hendricks (2016) places the scene slightly before Narmer~ based~ in part on the uncharacteristic absence of Narmer's royal name in the inscription.(Shamshi-Adad dynasty 1808–1736 BCE) (Amorites) Shamshi-Adad I Ishme-Dagan I Mut-Ashkur Rimush Asinum Ashur-dugul Ashur-apla-idi Nasir-Sin Sin-namir Ipqi-Ishtar Adad-salulu Adasi (Non-dynastic usurpers 1735–1701 BCE) Puzur-Sin Ashur-dugul Ashur-apla-idi Nasir-Sin Sin-namir Ipqi-Ishtar Adad-salulu Adasi (Adaside dynasty 1700–722 BCE) Bel-bani Libaya Sharma-Adad I Iptar-Sin Bazaya Lullaya Shu-Ninua Sharma-Adad II Erishum III Shamshi-Adad II Ishme-Dagan II Shamshi-Adad III Ashur-nirari I Puzur-Ashur III Enlil-nasir I Nur-ili Ashur-shaduni Ashur-rabi I Ashur-nadin-ahhe I Enlil-Nasir II Ashur-nirari II Ashur-bel-nisheshu Ashur-rim-nisheshu Ashur-nadin-ahhe IISecond Intermediate Period Sixteenth Dynasty Abydos Dynasty Seventeenth Dynasty(1500–1100 BCE) Kidinuid dynasty Igehalkid dynasty Untash-NapirishaTwenty-first Dynasty of Egypt Smendes Amenemnisu Psusennes I Amenemope Osorkon the Elder Siamun Psusennes IITwenty-third Dynasty of Egypt Harsiese A Takelot II Pedubast I Shoshenq VI Osorkon III Takelot III Rudamun Menkheperre Ini Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt Tefnakht Bakenranef(Sargonid dynasty) Tiglath-Pileser† Shalmaneser† Marduk-apla-iddina II Sargon† Sennacherib† Marduk-zakir-shumi II Marduk-apla-iddina II Bel-ibni Ashur-nadin-shumi† Nergal-ushezib Mushezib-Marduk Esarhaddon† Ashurbanipal Ashur-etil-ilani Sinsharishkun Sin-shumu-lishir Ashur-uballit II
9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes,Menes - Wikipedia,8885,0.0000,Menes (fl. c. 3200–3000 BC;[1] /ˈmeɪneɪz/; Ancient Egyptian: mnj~ probably pronounced */maˈnij/;[6] Ancient Greek: Μήνης[5] and Μήν[7]) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt~ credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt~ and as the founder of the First Dynasty.[8]The identity of Menes is the subject of ongoing debate~ although mainstream Egyptological consensus inconclusively identifies Menes with the Naqada III ruler Narmer[2][3][4][9] or his successor~ the First Dynasty pharaoh Hor-Aha.[10]The commonly-used name Menes derives from Manetho~ an Egyptian historian and priest who lived during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Manetho noted the name in Greek as Μήνης (transliterated: Mênês).[5][11] An alternative Greek form~ Μιν (transliterated: Min)~ was cited by the fifth-century-BC historian Herodotus~[12] but this variant is no longer accepted; it appears to have been the result of contamination from the name of the god Min.[13] The Egyptian form~ mnj~ is taken from the Turin and Abydos King Lists~ which are dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty~ whose pronunciation has been reconstructed as */maˈnij/. By the early New Kingdom~ changes in the Egyptian language meant his name was already pronounced */maˈneʔ/.[14] The name mnj means "He who endures"~ which~ I.E.S. Edwards (1971) suggests~ may have been coined as "a mere descriptive epithet denoting a semi-legendary hero [...] whose name had been lost".[5] Rather than a particular person~ the name may conceal the collective identity of the Naqada III rulers: Ka~ Scorpion II and Narmer~ or may simply refer to a functional leadership role.[5]The almost complete absence of any mention of Menes in the archaeological record[5] and the comparative wealth of evidence of Narmer~ a protodynastic figure credited by posterity and in the archaeological record with a firm claim[3] to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt~ has given rise to a theory identifying Menes with Narmer.The chief archaeological reference to Menes is an ivory label (from the town Naqada) which depicts the royal title Aha (the pharaoh Hor-Aha) next to a building~ and within this is the royal title mn~[15] generally taken to be Menes.[5][a] From this~ various theories on the nature of the building (a funerary booth or a shrine)~ the meaning of the word mn (a name or the verb endures) and the relationship between Hor-Aha and Menes (as one person or as successive pharaohs) have arisen.[2]The Turin and Abydos king lists~ generally accepted to be correct~[2] list the nesu-bit-names of the pharaohs~ not their Horus-names~[3] and are vital to the potential reconciliation of the various records: the nesu-bit-names of the king lists~ the Horus-names of the archaeological record and the number of pharaohs in Dynasty I according to Manetho and other historical sources.[3]Flinders Petrie first attempted this task~[3] associating Iti with Djer as the third pharaoh of Dynasty I~ Teti (Turin) (or another Iti (Abydos)) with Hor-Aha as second pharaoh~ and Menes (a nebty-name) with Narmer (a Horus-name) as first pharaoh of Dynasty I.[2][3] Lloyd (1994) finds this succession "extremely probable"~[3] and Cervelló-Autuori (2003) categorically states that "Menes is Narmer and the First Dynasty begins with him".[4] However~ Seidlmayer (2004) states that it is "a fairly safe inference" that Menes was Hor-Aha.[10]Two documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively Hor-Aha was Menes. The first is the "Naqada Label" found at the site of Naqada~ in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep~ often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha.[16] The label shows a serekh of Hor-Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name "Menes". The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a serekh of Narmer and the chessboard symbol~ "mn"~ which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor-Aha being Menes~ but in neither case is the argument conclusive.[b]The second document~ the seal impression from Abydos~ shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign (mn)~ together with its phonetic complement~ the n sign~ which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written~ again representing the name "Menes". At first glance~ this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes.[20] However~ based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions~ which contain the name of one or more princes~ the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes~ hence Menes was Narmer's successor~ Hor-Aha~ and thus Hor-Aha was Menes.[21] This was refuted by Cervelló-Autuori 2005~ pp. 42–45 harvnb error: no target: CITEREFCervelló-Autuori2005 (help); but opinions still vary~ and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory.[22]Herodotus~ after having mentioned the first king of Egypt~ Min~ he wrote that Linus~ called by the Egyptians Maneros~ was "the only son of the first king of Egypt" and that he died untimely.[23]Egyptologists~ archaeologists~ and scholars from the 19th century have proposed different dates for the era of Menes~ or the date of the first dynasty:[24][c]Modern consensus dates the era of Menes or the start of the first dynasty between c. 3200–3030 BC; some academic literature uses c. 3000 BC.[1]Ancient tradition ascribes to Menes to uniting Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom[25] and becoming the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty.[26] Although name does not appear on extant pieces of the Royal Annals (Cairo Stone and Palermo Stone)~ his name appears in later sources as the first ruler of Egypt. Some sources credit him as directly inheriting the throne from the god Horus.[27] He also appears in later dated king's lists~ always as the first human pharaoh of Egypt. Menes appears in demotic novels of the Hellenistic period~ demonstrating that~ even that late~ he was regarded as an important figure.[28]Menes was seen as a founding figure for much of the history of ancient Egypt~ similar to Romulus in ancient Rome.[29] Manetho records that Menes "led the army across the frontier and won great glory".[11][26]Manetho associates the city of Thinis with the Early Dynastic Period and~ in particular~ Menes~ a "Thinite" or native of Thinis.[11][26] Herodotus contradicts Manetho in stating that Menes founded the city of Memphis as his capital[30] after diverting the course of the Nile through the construction of a levee.[31] Manetho ascribes the building of Memphis to Menes' son~ Athothis~[26] and calls no pharaohs earlier than Third Dynasty "Memphite".[32]Herodotus and Manetho's stories of the foundation of Memphis are probably later inventions: in 2012 a relief mentioning the visit to Memphis by Iry-Hor—a predynastic ruler of Upper Egypt reigning before Narmer—was discovered in the Sinai Peninsula~ indicating that the city was already in existence in the early 32nd century BC.[33]Diodorus Siculus stated that Menes had introduced the worship of the gods and the practice of sacrifice[34] as well as a more elegant and luxurious style of living.[34] For this latter invention~ Menes' memory was dishonoured by the Twenty-fourth Dynasty pharaoh Tefnakht and Plutarch mentions a pillar at Thebes on which was inscribed an imprecation against Menes as the introducer of luxury.[34]In Pliny's[clarification needed] account~ Menes was credited with being the inventor of writing in Egypt.Diodorus Siculus recorded a story of Menes related by the priests of the crocodile god Sobek at Crocodilopolis~ in which the pharaoh Menes~ attacked by his own dogs while out hunting~[35] fled across Lake Moeris on the back of a crocodile and~ in thanks~ founded the city of Crocodilopolis.[35][36][37]Gaston Maspero (1910)~ while acknowledging the possibility that traditions relating to other kings may have become mixed up with this story~ dismisses the suggestions of some commentators[38] that the story should be transferred to the Twelfth Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III and sees no reason to doubt that Diodorus did not correctly record a tradition of Menes.[35] Later~ Edwards (1974) states that "the legend~ which is obviously filled with anachronisms~ is patently devoid of historical value".[36]According to Manetho~ Menes reigned for either 30~ 60 or 62 years and was killed by a hippopotamus.[11][39]Alexander Dow (1735/6–79)~ a Scottish orientalist and playwright~ wrote the tragedy Sethona~ set in ancient Egypt. The lead part of Menes is described in the dramatis personæ as "next male-heir to the crown" now worn by Seraphis~ and was played by Samuel Reddish in a 1774 production by David Garrick at the Theatre Royal~ Drury Lane.[40]
10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II,Nectanebo II - Wikipedia,12375,0.0000,Nectanebo II (Egyptian: Nḫt-Ḥr-Ḥbt; Greek: Νεκτανεβώς Nectanebos) was the last native ruler of ancient Egypt~ as well as the third and last pharaoh of the Thirtieth Dynasty~ reigning from 358 to 340 BC.During the reign of Nectanebo II~ Egyptian artists developed a specific style that left a distinctive mark on the reliefs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.[6] Like his indirect predecessor Nectanebo I~ Nectanebo II showed enthusiasm for many of the cults of the gods within ancient Egyptian religion~ and more than a hundred Egyptian sites bear evidence of his attention.[7]For several years~ Nectanebo II was successful in keeping Egypt safe from the Achaemenid Empire.[8] However~ he was betrayed by his former servant~ Mentor of Rhodes~ and ultimately defeated. The Persians occupied Memphis and then seized the rest of Egypt~ incorporating the country into the Achaemenid Empire under Artaxerxes III. Nectanebo fled south.[9] His subsequent fate is unknown.Nectanebo is derived from the Greek form of his name~ Nectanebos (Νεκτανεβώς~ or Νεκτανεβός in later sources). His Egyptian name was Nḫt-Ḥr-Ḥbt~[10] which means "victorious is Horus of Hebyt".[11] Although convention in English assigns identical names to him and his grandfather~ Nectanebo I~ the latter was in fact called Nectanebis (Νεκτάνεβις).[12]Medieval Arab authors referred to him as Naqatanibas (Arabic: ناقاطانيباس).[13]In 525 BC~ Egypt was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. Because of internal struggles for the Persian imperial succession~ Egypt managed to regain independence in 404 BC. In 389 BC~ Pharaoh Hakor negotiated a treaty with Athens and for three years (from 385 to 383 BC) managed to withstand Persian aggression.[14] However~ following the conclusion of the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC between the Achaemenids and the Greek city-states~ Egypt and Cyprus became the only obstacles to Persian hegemony in the Mediterranean.At the beginning of 360 BC~ Nectanebo's predecessor~ Teos~ started preparations for war against intruders. In the same year~ the Egyptian army set off~ traveling along the coast by land and sea. Nectanebo II accompanied his uncle Teos in that campaign and was in charge of the machimoi.[15]In an attempt to quickly raise finances for the war~ Teos imposed taxes on Egyptians and seized temple property.[16] Egyptians~ particularly the priests~ resented these measures but supported Nectanebo II. Teos asked Spartan military leader Agesilaus and Athenian general Chabrias to support him.[17] Agesilaus~ however~ said he was sent to aid Egypt and not to wage war against it.[17] Chabrias returned home with his mercenaries.[17] Teos decided to flee to the Achaemenid court~ where he ultimately died of natural causes.Nectanebo contended with an unnamed pretender to the throne from the town of Mendes~ who proclaimed himself pharaoh.[17] The revolt was probably led by one of the descendants of Nepherites I~ whose family had ruled the town before.[18] The claimant sent messengers to Agesilaus in an attempt to persuade Agesilaus to his side.[17] Agesilaus remained loyal to Nectanebo~ fearing to become a turncoat. At one of the towns in the Nile Delta~ the troops of Nectanebo and Agesilaus were besieged by the usurper~ who had gained many sympathisers. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority~ Nectanebo and Agesilaus were victorious and the revolt was put down in the fall of 360 BC.[19]Religion played an important part in Nectanebo's domestic policy. He began his reign by officiating over the funeral of an Apis bull in Memphis. There~ Nectanebo added a relief decoration to the eastern and western temples of Apis.[22] Among notable sanctuaries erected under Nectanebo II are a temple of Khnum in Abu and a temple of Amun at Sekhtam. He also dedicated a diorite naos to Anhur-Shu (a fragment of it was found in the temples of Tjebnutjer).[6] Nectanebo II was responsible for the increasing popularity of the Buchis cult.[19] Under Nectanebo II a decree forbidding stone quarrying in the so-called "Mysterious Mountains" in Abydos was issued.[23]Foreign affairs under Nectanebo II were thwarted by repeated Achaemenid attempts to reoccupy Egypt. Before the accession of Nectanebo II to the throne~ the Persians attempted to reclaim Egypt in 385~ 383~ and 373 BC. Nectanebo used the peace to build up a new army and employed Greek mercenaries~ which was a common practice at the time. In about 351 BC~ the Achaemenid Empire embarked on a new attempt to reclaim Egypt. After a year of fighting~ Nectanebo and his allied generals~ Diophantus of Athens [ca] and Lamius of Sparta~ managed to defeat the Achaemenids. Having scored a resounding victory~ Nectanebo II was acclaimed "Nectanebo the divine falcon" by his people~ and cults were set up in his name.[24]In 345/44 BC~ Nectanebo supported the Phoenician rebellion against the Achaemenid Empire~ led by the king of Sidon~ Tennes~[25] and dispatched military aid in the form of 4~000 Greek mercenaries~ led by Mentor of Rhodes.[26] However~ having heard of the approach of the forces of Artaxerxes III~ Mentor opened communication with the Persians in collusion with Tennes.[26]At the end of 344 BC~ ambassadors of Artaxerxes III arrived in Greece~ asking for the Greeks' participation in a campaign against Egypt.[27] Athens and Sparta treated the ambassadors with courtesy~ but refrained from committing to an alliance against Egypt.[27] Other cities~ however~ decided to support the Persians: Thebes sent 1~000 hoplites and Argos 3~000.[27]In the winter of 343 BC~ Artaxerxes set off for Egypt. The Egyptian army~ headed by Nectanebo~ consisted of 60~000 Egyptians~ 20~000 Libu~ and as many Greek mercenaries.[28] In addition~ Nectanebo had a number of flat-bottomed boats intended to prevent an enemy from entering the Nile mouths.[29] The vulnerable points along his Mediterranean sea border and east boundary were protected by strongholds~ fortifications and entrenched camps.[29] Persian forces were strengthened by Mentor and his men~ well acquainted with the eastern border of Egypt~ and by 6~000 Ionians.[26]Nectanebo II was ultimately defeated and~ in the summer of 342 BC~ Artaxerxes entered Memphis[30] and installed a satrap.[31] Nectanebo fled to Upper Egypt and finally to Nubia~ where he was granted asylum. He~ however~ preserved a degree of power there for some time. With the help of Khabash~ Nectanebo made a vain attempt to regain the throne.[32]Though placed in an unfortunate period of Egyptian history~ and with his legacy perhaps marred by being "the last pharaoh" to rule an autonomous Egypt~ Nectanebo was an extensive builder~ likely on a scale that would equal many kings of the glory days of the New Kingdom.[33] References to either Nectanebo II or his grandfather have been found almost ubiquitously at the premier religious centres~ and the piety of the two kings matched those of the great kings of the past~ attested to by the numerous monuments across Egypt bearing their names.[22] Nectanebo II~ specifically~ built and improved temples across the country~ and he donated extensively to the priesthoods of the plethora of sites which he donated to. Nectanebo's name has been found at Heliopolis~ Athribis~ and Bubastis in the Nile Delta~ among other places~ but he built most extensively at Sebennytos~[34] including the modern site of Behbeit El Hagar. The reliefs of the temples at Sebennytos would leave a distinct mark on the art of the later Ptolemaic Kingdom. The religious focus of his building campaigns~ however~ may not be solely due to sheer piety; because Nectanebo was an usurper~ he likely sought to legitimise his rule over Egypt religiously.[33]Except for the small-scale greywacke statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art~ which shows Nectanebo II standing before the image of Horus~ no other annotated portraits of Nectanebo II are known.[35] In the greywacke statue~ Nectanebo II is shown in a nemes and uraeus. His bent arm with the sword stands for the hieroglyph nakht~ the falcon represents Horus~ while the hieroglyph in Nectanebo's right hand stands for heb.[36] Other portraits attributed to Nectanebo II (all featuring the khepresh) include a quartzite head in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology~ a basalt head in Alexandria~ a granite head acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts~ Boston and a damaged quartzite head.[35]In 1798~ Napoleon captured the Egyptian city of Alexandria.[37] Soon after~ following the Battle of Alexandria in 1801~ Napoleon's forces surrendered to the British~ and conditionally turned over antiquities they had gathered from the ancient city. Notably~ among these was the Rosetta Stone~ as well as a seven ton sarcophagus~ covered in hieroglyphics. Soon after the British secured these~ they were approached by locals who believed that this was the tomb of Alexander the Great.[38] Thereafter~ the sarcophagus was taken to London~ where it still resides at the British Museum.[39]For a time~ the tomb was believed to have belonged to Alexander. However~ after the translation of the Rosetta Stone~ the writings on the sarcophagus were deciphered~ and it became clear the tomb was not fashioned for him. The hieroglyphics on the tomb were sections from the Book of What is in the Underworld~ and contained the cartouche of Nectanebo II.[38] The tomb was likely created for Nectanebo~ before going unused as he was overthrown and fled to Nubia.[40]It has been argued that the sarcophagus did indeed house the remains of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great's body was temporarily entombed in Memphis following his death~ and Saqqara is a suspected location of his temporary Memphite tomb. Nectanebo had erected a temple there~ where he may have intended to be laid to rest. It is possible the tomb was vacant in Memphis at the same time Alexander's body was placed there. When Alexander's remains were moved to Alexandria~ it may have been along with the sarcophagus.[38]At the Attarine Mosque~ where it was found by Napoleon's men~ holes had been drilled in the sarcophagus. It had been used as a ritual bath when Alexandria was under Islamic rule.[39]There is an apocryphal tale appearing in the pseudo-historical Alexander romance that details another end for the last native pharaoh. Soon after Alexander the Great's godhood was confirmed by the Libyan Sibyl of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa Oasis~ a rumor was begun that Nectanebo II~ following defeat in his last battle~ did not travel to Nubia but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. There~ while Philip was away on campaign~ Nectanebo convinced Philip's wife Olympias that Amun was to come to her and that they would father a son. Nectanebo~ disguising himself as Amun~ slept with Olympias and from this event came Alexander.[41]This myth would hold strong appeal for the Egyptians~ who desired continuity and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule. In art of this event~ Nectanebo is usually depicted as having dragon-like features~ for example in the Speculum Historiale.[42]In the early Ptolemaic tale of Nectanebo and Petesis~[43] preserved only in a Greek fragment from the Serapeum of Saqqara~ the pharaoh has a prophetic dream of Isis in which the god Onuris is angry with him because of his unfinished temple in Sebennytos. Nectanebo calls in the best sculptor of the realm~ Petesis~ to finish the job~ but he bungles his assignment when he gets drunk and chases a beautiful girl instead. The narrative ends abruptly here~ but this is probably the preface to the fall of Egypt.[44] Al-Biruni's A History of India reproduces the story.[45]The legend of Nectanebo (or Nectanebus~ or Natanabo~ as reported in some versions of the Alexander Romance) left a profound mark on European culture up to the Renaissance and beyond. It is no coincidence that this character is included in the Sola Busca tarot (with the name Natanabo) together with other important "actors" of the same legend: Alexander~ Philip of Macedon~ Olympias and Ammon.[46] An alchemical interpretation of this character was provided by the Italian scholar Sofia Di Vincenzo in a study on the Sola Busca Tarot~ where she explains that Natanabo represents a celestial messenger who came to earth with a gift~ the helmet~ which is a symbol of invulnerability and both physical and mental potency.[47]
11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra,Cleopatra - Wikipedia,86754,0.0000,Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator (Koinē Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Θεά Φιλοπάτωρ[note 5] lit. Cleopatra "father-loving goddess";[note 6] 70/69 BC – 10 August 30 BC) was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC~ and its last active ruler.[note 7] A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty~ she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter~ a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.[note 8] After the death of Cleopatra~ Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire~ marking the end of the last Hellenistic-period state in the Mediterranean and of the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).[note 9] Her first language was Koine Greek~ and she was the only known Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.[note 10]In 58 BC~ Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father~ Ptolemy XII Auletes~ during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a Roman client state) allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC~ the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began~ but a falling-out between them led to an open civil war. After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar (a Roman dictator and consul) in Caesar's civil war~ the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII~ but Ptolemy XIII~ at the urging of his court eunuchs~ had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings~ but Ptolemy's chief adviser~ Potheinos~ viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra~ so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements~ Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile; Cleopatra's half-sister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son~ Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC~ where she stayed at Caesar's villa. After Caesar's assassination~ followed shortly afterwards by that of Ptolemy XIV (on Cleopatra's orders)~ she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.In the Liberators' civil war of 43–42 BC~ Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir Octavian~ Mark Antony~ and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC~ the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request~ and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event~ their marriage~ and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister Octavia Minor led to the final war of the Roman Republic. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda~ forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC~ and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium~ Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony~ leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession~ she killed herself by poisoning~ contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp.Cleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts~ her ancient depictions include Roman busts~ paintings~ and sculptures~ cameo carvings and glass~ Ptolemaic and Roman coinage~ and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art~ she was the subject of many works including operas~ paintings~ poetry~ sculptures~ and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era~ and in modern times~ Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts~ burlesque satire~ Hollywood films~ and brand images for commercial products.The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleopátra (Κλεοπάτρα)~ meaning "glory of her father"~[5] from κλέος (kléos~ "glory") and πατήρ (patḗr~ "father").[6] The masculine form would have been written either as Kleópatros (Κλεόπατρος) or Pátroklos (Πάτροκλος).[6] Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister Cleopatra of Macedonia~ as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology~ Cleopatra Alcyone.[7] Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess)~ the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty.[8][9] Cleopatra's adopted title Theā́ Philopátōra (Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα) means "goddess who loves her father".[10][11][note 11]Ptolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis~ but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria~ established by Alexander the Great.[13][14][15][note 12] They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs~ refusing to learn the native Egyptian language.[16][17][18][note 10] In contrast~ Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language.[19][20][18][note 13] Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian~ the language of the "Troglodytes"~ Hebrew (or Aramaic)~ Arabic~ the Syrian language (perhaps Syriac)~ Median~ and Parthian~ and she could apparently also speak Latin~ although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek.[20][18][21][note 14] Aside from Greek~ Egyptian~ and Latin~ these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.[22]Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra.[23][24][25] When Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC~ he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III.[26][27] With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch~ Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II~ an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla.[26][27] Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC~ and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination.[26][28][29] Ptolemy XI~ and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I~ willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans~ so that the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt~ their client state~ after the assassination of Ptolemy XI.[26][30][31] The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX~ bestowing Cyprus on Ptolemy of Cyprus and Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes.[26][28]Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother~[32][33][note 15] presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena)~[34][35][36][note 16][note 3] the mother of Cleopatra's older sister~ Berenice IV Epiphaneia.[37][38][39][note 17] Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.[40][41] The three younger children of Ptolemy XII~ Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV~[37][38][39] were born in the absence of his wife.[42][43] Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos~ from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy.[44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum~ including the Library of Alexandria.[45][46]In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt~ but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected.[49][50] Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen~ such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus~ and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC.[51][52][53][note 19] However~ Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him~ and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.[54][55][56]In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus~ Ptolemy XII's brother~ to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos.[57][58][56][note 20] Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother~ a decision which~ along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans~ damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies.[57][59][60] Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force~ traveling first to Rhodes~ then Athens~ and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills~ near Praeneste~ Italy.[57][58][61][note 21]Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year there on the outskirts of Rome~ ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra~ then about 11.[57][61][note 22] Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy~ an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters.[62][55][63][note 23] When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt~ he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.[64][65][66]The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power.[67] Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius~ the Roman governor of Syria~ to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII~ offering him 10~000 talents for the proposed mission.[67][68][69] Although it put him at odds with Roman law~ Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea~ where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean~ father of Herod the Great~ furnish the Roman-led army with supplies.[67][70] As a young cavalry officer~ Mark Antony was under Gabinius's command.[71] He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion~ and for rescuing the body of Archelaos~ the husband of Berenice IV~ after he was killed in battle~ ensuring him a proper royal burial.[72][73] Cleopatra~ then 14 years of age~ would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later~ Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.[72][74]Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority~ for which he was acquitted~ but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile~ from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar.[75][76] Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt~ but he was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.[75][77] Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed~ seizing their properties.[78][79][80] He allowed Gabinius's largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison~ the Gabiniani~ to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.[78][81][82][note 24]Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources.[83][84][80][note 25] Despite these problems~ Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs~ oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera~ and stabilized the economy.[85][84][86][note 26] On 31 May 52 BC~ Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII~ as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera.[87][88][89][note 27] Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII's debt by the time of the latter's death~ and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.[83][76]Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC~ when Cleopatra~ in her first act as queen~ began her voyage to Hermonthis~ near Thebes~ to install a new sacred Buchis bull~ worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion.[90][91][92][note 29] Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile~ and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani~ the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt.[93][94] Inheriting her father's debts~ Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas.[95]In 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus~ proconsul of Syria~ sent his two eldest sons to Egypt~ most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians.[96] The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two~ perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court.[96][97] Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment~ but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication~ which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate.[98][97] Bibulus~ siding with Pompey in Caesar's Civil War~ failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece~ which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.[98]By 29 August 51 BC~ official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler~ evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler.[95][97][99] She had probably married him~[77] but there is no record of this.[90] The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II.[100][101][102] A long-held royal Egyptian practice~ it was loathed by contemporary Greeks.[100][101][102][note 30] By the reign of Cleopatra~ however~ it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.[100][101][102]Despite Cleopatra's rejection of him~ Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies~ notably the eunuch Potheinos~ his childhood tutor~ regent~ and administrator of his properties.[103][94][104] Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas~ a prominent military commander~ and Theodotus of Chios~ another tutor of Ptolemy XIII.[103][105] Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV~ but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister~ followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.[90][106][107][note 31]In the summer of 49 BC~ Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived~ seeking military aid on behalf of his father.[106] After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC~ Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece.[108][109] In perhaps their last joint decree~ both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops~ including the Gabiniani~ a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome.[108][110] Losing the fight against her brother~ Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes.[111][112][113] By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister~ Arsinoe IV~ to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt.[114][107][115] She returned with an army~ but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces~ including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her~ so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.[116][107][117]In Greece~ Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC~ leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to Tyre~ Lebanon.[116][118][119][note 32] Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies~ Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge~ where he could replenish his forces.[120][119][117][note 33] Ptolemy XIII's advisers~ however~ feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war.[120][121][122] In a scheme devised by Theodotus~ Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message~ only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC.[120][118][123][note 34] Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's head~ severed and embalmed~ sent to Caesar~ who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace.[124][125][126][note 34] Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.[124][127][126][note 35]Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army~ in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival.[128][129] Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar~ but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women~ she came to Alexandria to see him personally.[128][130][129] Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother~ dressed in an attractive manner~ and charmed Caesar with her wit.[128][131][132] Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.[128][133][134][note 36]When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar~ he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot~ but he was arrested by Caesar~ who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd.[135][136][137] Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria~ where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII—previously possessed by Pompey—naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs.[138][136][130][note 37] Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings~ Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV~ to rule together over Cyprus~ thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.[139][136][140][note 37]Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20~000~ including the Gabiniani~ could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4~000 unsupported troops~ Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra.[139][136][141][note 38] After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos~ Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen~ but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army.[142][143][144][note 39] Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator~ only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV.[142][145][146] The resulting siege of the palace~ with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside~ lasted into the following year of 47 BC.[147][127][148][note 40]Sometime between January and March of 47 BC~ Caesar's reinforcements arrived~ including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean.[142][127][149][note 41] Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile~ where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat~ but it capsized~ and he drowned.[150][127][151][note 42] Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia~ by Marcus Junius Brutus~ and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.[152][153][154] Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace~ most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar's child since September 48 BC.[155][156][157]Caesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC.[152] However~ Antony~ an officer of his~ helped to secure Caesar's appointment as dictator lasting for a year~ until October 47 BC~ providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt.[152] Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra's sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler~ Caesar appointed Cleopatra's 12-year-old brother~ Ptolemy XIV~ as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage~ but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar.[158][127][149][note 43] The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known~ although she had a governor there by 42 BC.[159][149]Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments~[127][160][161] although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event.[162] The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage~ including use of Thalamegos~ the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV~ which during his reign measured 90 metres (300 ft) in length and 24 metres (80 ft) in height and was complete with dining rooms~ state rooms~ holy shrines~ and promenades along its two decks~ resembling a floating villa.[162][163] Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas~ and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river~ but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.[164][165]Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC~ allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus~ the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus~ who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia.[166] It is possible that Caesar~ married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia~ also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son.[166][160] He left three legions in Egypt~ later increased to four~ under the command of the freedman Rufio~ to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position~ but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.[166][167][168]Caesarion~ Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar~ was born 23 June 47 BC and was originally named "Pharaoh Caesar"~ as preserved on a stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara.[170][127][171][note 44] Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia~ Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private).[172][note 45] Cleopatra~ on the other hand~ made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage~ naming Caesar as the father.[172][173][174]Cleopatra and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC~ presumably without Caesarion~ and were given lodging in Caesar's villa within the Horti Caesaris.[175][171][176][note 46] As with their father Ptolemy XII~ Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of "friend and ally of the Roman people" (Latin: socius et amicus populi Romani)~ in effect client rulers loyal to Rome.[177][178][179] Cleopatra's visitors at Caesar's villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero~ who found her arrogant.[180][181] Sosigenes of Alexandria~ one of the members of Cleopatra's court~ aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar~ put into effect 1 January 45 BC.[182][183][184] The Temple of Venus Genetrix~ established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC~ contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD)~ associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess Venus~ mother of the Romans.[185][183][186] The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.[180]Cleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesar's assassination.[187][188] Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesar's head~ but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance~ perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship.[187][188] Cicero~ who was present at the festival~ mockingly asked where the diadem came from~ an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred.[187][188] Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC)~ but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April~ in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir.[189][190][191] However~ Caesar's will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir~ and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.[189][190][192] A few months later~ Cleopatra had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning~ elevating her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.[193][194][174][note 47]Octavian~ Antony~ and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC~ in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice.[196][197] Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus~ one of Caesar's assassins~ and Publius Cornelius Dolabella~ proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist~ requesting military aid.[196] She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems~ while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella.[196][198] These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.[196][198]While Serapion~ Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus~ defected to Cassius and provided him with ships~ Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting.[196][199] By the autumn of 42 BC~ Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece~ leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.[196][200]By the end of 42 BC~ Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half~ with Lepidus largely marginalized.[201] In the summer of 41 BC~ Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters~ which she rebuffed until Antony's envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come.[202][203] The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant~ but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal~ romantic relationship with the queen.[204][203] Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in Thalamegos~ hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship.[205][206][note 48] Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius~ arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria~ and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister~ Arsinoe IV~ executed at Ephesus.[207][208] Cleopatra's former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.[207][209]Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos~ which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC.[207][210] Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria~ both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done.[211][212] In Egypt~ Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos.[213][209] He also had his subordinates~ such as Publius Ventidius Bassus~ drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.[212][214][215][note 49]Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs~ as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise.[216] With his powers as a triumvir~ Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands~ which were currently in Roman hands~ to Cleopatra.[217][218] While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatra's control by 19 November 38 BC~ the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41–40 BC~ during her time spent with Antony.[217]By the spring of 40 BC~ Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria~ where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus~ a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire.[219] Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories.[219] She would not see Antony again until 37 BC~ but she maintained correspondence~ and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp.[219] By the end of 40 BC~ Cleopatra had given birth to twins~ a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II~ both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children.[220][221] Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation~[222] as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.[212]Mark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War (41–40 BC)~ initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome.[222][223] It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra~ but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos.[224] Fulvia and Antony's brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia (modern Perugia~ Italy) and then exiled from Italy~ after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony.[225] Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC.[225][212] Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the Ionian Sea~ it also stipulated that he concede Italia~ Hispania~ and Gaul~ and marry Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger~ a potential rival for Cleopatra.[226][227]In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea.[228] Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony~ but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty.[228] The latter had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael~ who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court.[228] Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment~ but Herod declined and traveled to Rome~ where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea.[229][230] This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra~ who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.[229]Relations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia~ but also sired her two children~ Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC~ and moved his headquarters to Athens.[234] However~ Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure.[212] Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance~ but received none from Cleopatra.[234] Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1 January 37 BC~ Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum~ where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC.[235] With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia~ Antony traveled to Antioch~ where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.[236]Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues~ such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign.[236][237] Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch~ where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future.[238][239] In order to stabilize the east~ Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain~[237] he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him~ yet would ultimately outlast him.[240][218][note 51]In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant~ including nearly all of Phoenicia (Lebanon) minus Tyre and Sidon~ which remained in Roman hands.[241][218][237] She also received Ptolemais Akko (modern Acre~ Israel)~ a city that was established by Ptolemy II.[241] Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids~ she was granted the region of Coele-Syria along the upper Orontes River.[242][237] She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine~ but she leased this territory back to Herod.[243][230] At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I (a cousin of Herod)~ Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea~ including Ailana (modern Aqaba~ Jordan).[244][230] To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast~ as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete.[245][237] Although still administered by Roman officials~ these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating her coinage in 36 BC.[246][247]Antony's enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian~ who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic.[248] Octavian~ fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia~ granted both her and Livia~ his own wife~ extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity.[248] Some 50 years before~ Cornelia Africana~ daughter of Scipio Africanus~ had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her.[246] She was now followed by Octavia and Livia~ whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's~ erected by Caesar.[246]In 36 BC~ Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire.[249] She then returned to Egypt~ perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy.[250] By the summer of 36 BC~ she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus~ her second son with Antony.[250][237]Antony's Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons~ in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia~ who defected to the Parthian side.[251][218][252] After losing some 30~000 men~ more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge)~ Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus (modern Beirut~ Lebanon) in December~ engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops.[251][253] Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome~ and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.[251]As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC~ this time aimed at their ally Armenia~ Octavia traveled to Athens with 2~000 troops in alleged support of Antony~ but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses.[256][257][note 52] Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch~ only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria.[256][257] When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony~ although she refused to leave Antony's household.[258][218] Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west~ including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus~ the third member of the triumvirate~ who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.[258][218][253]Dellius was sent as Antony's envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian king's daughter to Alexander Helios~ the son of Antony and Cleopatra.[259][260] When this was declined~ Antony marched his army into Armenia~ defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family.[259][261] Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph~ dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra~ who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais.[259][262] News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.[259]In an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph~ Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion~ King of Kings~ while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia~ Media~ and Parthia~ and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphos was declared king of Syria and Cilicia.[266][267][268] Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene.[269][270] Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony.[269][268][note 53] Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims~ now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes~ but the two consuls~ both supporters of Antony~ had it censored from public view.[271][270]In late 34 BC~ Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years.[272][270][174][note 54] Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy~ while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia~ marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia~ and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian.[272][270] The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustan-period literature through to various media in modern times.[273][274] Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homer's Helen of Troy in destroying civilization.[275] Pliny the Elder claims in his Natural History that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet.[276][277] The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.[278]A papyrus document dated to February 33 BC~ later used to wrap a mummy~ contains the signature of Cleopatra~ probably written by an official authorized to sign for her.[263][264] It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassus~[note 55] a former Roman consul and Antony's confidant who would command his land forces at Actium.[279][264] A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads "make it happen"[279][264] or "so be it"[265] (Ancient Greek: γινέσθωι~ romanized: ginésthōi);[note 56] this is likely the autograph of the queen~ as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.[279][264]In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC~ Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen.[280] Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC~ Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian.[280] In 32 BC~ the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian~ now a private citizen without public office~ and introduced pieces of legislation against him.[279][281] During the next senatorial session~ Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls.[279][282] Intimidated by this act~ the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.[279][282][283]Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC~ where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire.[279] Ahenobarbus~ wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public~ attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian.[284][285] Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch.[284][285] Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt~ judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt.[284][285] Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans~ such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.[284][282]During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens~ where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce.[284][282][268] This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will~ invested with the Vestal Virgins.[284][282][270] Although a violation of sacred and legal rights~ Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta~ and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra.[284][270] Octavian highlighted parts of the will~ such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar~ that the Donations of Alexandria were legal~ that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome~ and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic.[286][282][270] In a show of loyalty to Rome~ Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius.[282] Octavian's legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC.[282] With Antony's will made public~ Octavian had his casus belli~ and Rome declared war on Cleopatra~[286][287][288] not Antony.[note 57] The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions~ with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony~ and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired.[289]Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian~ but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained~ some of them perhaps from merchant vessels~ whereas Octavian had a fully professional force.[290][285] Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium~[291] but Cleopatra~ concerned primarily with defending Egypt~ overrode the decision to attack Italy directly.[292][285] Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece~ and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium~ on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.[292][291]Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings~ but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod~ and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign.[293] They also lost the support of Malichus I~ which would prove to have strategic consequences.[294] Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC~ while defections to Octavian's camp continued~ including Antony's long-time companion Dellius[294] and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia.[294] While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland~ Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation~ to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt.[295]On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian~ led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa~ met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium.[295][291][287] Cleopatra~ aboard her flagship~ the Antonias~ commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf~ at the rear of the fleet~ in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle.[295] Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy~ which Cleopatra~ ever concerned about defending Egypt~ used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.[296][297][298]Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony~ but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible.[298] Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship~ identified by its distinctive purple sails~ as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron.[296] Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage~ until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her.[299] The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September~ and was followed by massive defections of officers~ troops~ and allied kings to Octavian's side.[299][297][300]While Octavian occupied Athens~ Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt.[299][303] The couple then went their separate ways~ Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory.[299] She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion.[304] It is uncertain whether or not~ at this time~ she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival~ Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene~ in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.[305][306]Lucius Pinarius~ Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene~ received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court.[305] Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian's side~ surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain.[305] Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers.[305] In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the Timoneion~ after the philosopher Timon of Athens~ who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy.[305] Herod~ who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra~ traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony.[307] Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty~ so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea~ further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.[307]Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC~ when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion.[308] Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him~ take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea~ and then set sail to a foreign port~ perhaps in India~ where she could spend time recuperating.[308][306] However~ these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I~ as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria~ Quintus Didius~ managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated.[308][306] Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian.[308] Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda~ it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.[309]Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the ephebi~ which~ along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC~ demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt.[310] In a show of solidarity~ Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus~ his son with Fulvia~ enter the ephebi at the same time.[308] Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian~ still stationed at Rhodes~ although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra.[309] Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt~ offered Octavian money in the future~ and immediately sent him lavish gifts.[309][306] Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction.[311] Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared~ but when Antony suspected foul intent~ he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.[312]After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results~ Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC~[313] stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia~ where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies.[314] Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion~ while Cornelius Gallus~ marching eastward from Cyrene~ defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion.[315][316] Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria~ but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's hippodrome.[315][316] However~ on 1 August 30 BC~ Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian~ followed by Antony's cavalry.[315][297][317]Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide.[315][318][319] In despair~ Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53.[315][297][306] According to Plutarch~ he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb~ telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian's companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage.[315][320][321] It was Proculeius~ however~ who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen~ denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures.[322][323] Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.[322][306]Octavian entered Alexandria~ occupied the palace~ and seized Cleopatra's three youngest children.[322][324] When she met with Octavian~ Cleopatra told him bluntly~ "I will not be led in a triumph" (Ancient Greek: οὑ θριαμβεύσομαι~ romanized: ou thriambéusomai)~ according to Livy~ a rare recording of her exact words.[325][326] Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom.[327] When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days~ she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV.[327][297][306] It is unclear if Cleopatra's suicide on 10 August 30 BC~ at age 39~ took place within the palace or her tomb.[328][329][note 4] It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion~ who also took their own lives.[327][330]Octavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb.[327][331][332] Cleopatra's physician Olympos did not explain her cause of death~ although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her.[333][334][306] Plutarch relates this tale~ but then suggests an implement (κνῆστις~ knêstis~ lit. 'spine~ cheese-grater') was used to introduce the toxin by scratching~ while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (βελόνη~ belónē)~ and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind.[335][334][336][note 58] No venomous snake was found with her body~ but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.[333][336][332]Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt~ perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia~ Ethiopia~ or India.[337][338][316] Caesarion~ now Ptolemy XV~ would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC~ after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king.[339][340][341][note 2] Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world.[342][note 59] With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom~ the Roman province of Egypt was established~[343][297][344][note 60] marking the end of the Hellenistic period.[345][346][note 9] In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus ("the revered") and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor~ inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.[347]Following the tradition of Macedonian rulers~ Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch~ serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom.[349] She was the chief religious authority in her realm~ presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths.[350] She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods~[351] a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt~ and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria~ dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.[352][353]Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain~[354] tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign.[355] Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality~[356] the government attempted to impose price controls~ tariffs~ and state monopolies for certain goods~ fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies~ and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons.[357][358][359] Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage~ which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.[360]After her suicide~ Cleopatra's three surviving children~ Cleopatra Selene II~ Alexander Helios~ and Ptolemy Philadelphos~ were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger~ a former wife of their father~ as their guardian.[365][366] Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC.[365][239] The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point.[365][239] Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II~ son of Juba I~ whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey.[367][366][324]The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II~ after their wedding in 25 BC~ as the new rulers of Mauretania~ where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital~ renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell~ Algeria).[367][239] Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars~ artists~ and advisers from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea~ now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture.[368] She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania~ in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.[369][370]Cleopatra Selene II died c. 5 BC~ and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy.[369][371] However~ Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD~ perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor.[372][373] Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty~ although Queen Zenobia~ of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century~ claimed descent from Cleopatra.[374][375] A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe~ an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis~ explained that he "overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold."[376]Although almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra~ these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium~ her suicide~ and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies.[378] Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra~ the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life.[379][380][381] Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources~ such as Philotas of Amphissa~ who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace~ Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos~ and Quintus Dellius~ a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.[382] Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition~ such as eyewitness reports.[379][381]The Jewish Roman historian Josephus~ writing in the 1st century AD~ provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great.[383][384] However~ this work relies largely on Herod's memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus~ the tutor of Cleopatra's children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod's court.[383][384] The Roman History published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD~ while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world~ nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra's reign.[383]Cleopatra is barely mentioned in De Bello Alexandrino~ the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar.[387][388][389][note 62] The writings of Cicero~ who knew her personally~ provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra.[387] The Augustan-period authors Virgil~ Horace~ Propertius~ and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime~[387][390] although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama.[391][note 63] Horace also viewed Cleopatra's suicide as a positive choice~[392][390] an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.[393][394]The historians Strabo~ Velleius~ Valerius Maximus~ Pliny the Elder~ and Appian~ while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch~ Josephus~ or Dio~ provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records.[387][note 64] Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatra's point of view~ but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works.[387][395][note 65] The fragmentary Libyka commissioned by Cleopatra's son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra's perspective.[387]Cleopatra's gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient~ medieval~ and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman world.[396] For instance~ the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree.[396] Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress~ she had only two known sexual partners~ Caesar and Antony~ the two most prominent Romans of the time period~ who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty.[397][398] Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.[399][15][400][note 66]Cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art~ in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles.[2] Surviving works include statues~ busts~ reliefs~ and minted coins~[2][377] as well as ancient carved cameos~[403] such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style~ now in the Altes Museum~ Berlin.[1] Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance~ there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome~ the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple.[3][185][404] It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD~ its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage~ although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.[405][406]A life-sized Roman-style statue of Cleopatra was found near the Tomba di Nerone [it]~ Rome~ along the Via Cassia~ and is now housed in the Museo Pio-Clementino~ part of the Vatican Museums.[1][385][386] Plutarch~ in his Life of Antonius~ said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus~ but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2~000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.[407][376][331]Since the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the Esquiline Venus—discovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitoline Museums—is a depiction of Cleopatra~ based on the statue's hairstyle and facial features~ apparent royal diadem worn over the head~ and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base.[402][408][409] Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite).[402][408][409] However~ she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis~[410] while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite.[411][412] She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos.[206] The Esquiline Venus is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD Roman copy of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.[408]Surviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year~ from 51 to 30 BC.[414] Cleopatra~ the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf~ almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins.[411][note 67] Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency.[415] Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony~ which also bear his image~ portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband.[3][416] These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple.[3][2]Her strong~ almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother~ softer~ and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles.[2][417][418] Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father~ Ptolemy XII Auletes~[419][115] and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II (316–260 BC)[2][420] and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti.[418] It is likely~ due to political expediency~ that Antony's visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty~ to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.[2]The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek~ but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins~ in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones.[2] These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture~ and perhaps also a statement to their subjects~ however ambiguous to modern scholars~ about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other.[2] Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra~ in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony~ made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler.[417] Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony~ such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant~ which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.[115][421]Various coins~ such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatra's marriage with Antony in 37 BC~ depict her wearing a royal diadem and a 'melon' hairstyle.[3][421] The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads.[422][377][423][note 68] This hairstyle~ with hair braided back into a bun~ is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage.[3][424] After her visit to Rome in 46–44 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles~ but it was abandoned for a more modest~ austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.[3][422][423]Of the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra~[note 69] the sculpture known as the "Berlin Cleopatra"~ located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum~ possesses her full nose~ whereas the head known as the "Vatican Cleopatra"~ located in the Vatican Museums~ is damaged with a missing nose.[425][426][427][note 70] Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems~ similar facial features~ and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.[426][428][427][note 71]Both heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy~ the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii.[3][425][427][note 72] Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun~ a diadem~ and a hooked nose.[429][note 73]A third sculpted portrait of Cleopatra accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell~ Algeria.[406][361][362] This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads~ but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II~ daughter of Cleopatra.[362][430][233][note 50] A possible Parian-marble sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums.[431] Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC~ it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.[432]Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum~ London~ made of limestone~ which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome.[1][422] The woman in this portrait has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose)~ but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle.[1][422] However~ the British Museum head~ once belonging to a full statue~ could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome.[422] Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head~ along with those in the Egyptian Museum~ Cairo~ the Capitoline Museums~ and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen~ while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem~ most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra's popular hairstyle.[433]In the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii~ Italy~ a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion.[408][434] The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC~ where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra.[408][434] This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii.[408][435]The woman in the painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra~ which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid's arm may have been torn off.[408][436][427][note 74] The room with the painting was walled off by its owner~ perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian~ when public depictions of Cleopatra's son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.[408][437]Behind her golden diadem~ crowned with a red jewel~ is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the "melon" hairstyle favored by the queen.[436][note 75] Her ivory-white skin~ round face~ long aquiline nose~ and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities.[436] Roller affirms that "there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and~ as such~ it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen."[408]Another painting from Pompeii~ dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II~ contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion~ both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide.[301][302][note 76] The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba~ who toward the end of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa~ King of Numidia.[301] Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family~ Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates~ and Cleopatra's own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.[301]Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made~ while Cleopatra's suicide was far more famous.[301] An asp is absent from the painting~ but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite.[441] A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting~ positioned very high above the people in it~ suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria.[301] A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile (possibly an elaborate tray handle)~ while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.[301]In 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrian's Villa~ near Tivoli~ Lazio~ Italy~ that depicted Cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest.[438] A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third wax and two-thirds resin.[438] The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra's bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits.[442] A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period~[443] as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers~ as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns.[440] After Cleopatra's suicide~ Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake~ parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome.[442][337][313] The portrait painting of Cleopatra's death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa~ where it was found in an Egyptian temple.[438][note 77]A Roman panel painting from Herculaneum~ Italy~ dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra.[47][48] In it she wears a royal diadem~ red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun~[note 78] pearl-studded hairpins~[444] and earrings with ball-shaped pendants~ the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background.[47] Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage.[47] A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery~ such as a Greek-style sphinx~ and may have been created by the same artist.[47]The Portland Vase~ a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum~ includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony.[445][447] In this interpretation~ Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs~ Eros floats above~ and Anton~ the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family~ looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom.[445][446] The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia~ abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother~ the emperor Augustus.[445][446] The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC~ when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.[445]The Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style.[448] Dated to the mid-1st century BC~ it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt.[448] The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art.[449] The Dendera Temple complex~ near Dendera~ Egypt~ contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods.[450][451] Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.[450][452]A large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring 104 centimetres (41 in) in height~ now in the Hermitage Museum~ Saint Petersburg~ is thought to represent Arsinoe II~ wife of Ptolemy II~ but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress~ an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt.[407][403][401] The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided~ double cornucopia (dikeras)~ which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra.[407][401] In his Kleopatra und die Caesaren (2006)~ Bernard Andreae [de] contends that this basalt statue~ like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen~ does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance.[453][note 79] Adrian Goldsworthy writes that~ despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style~ Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only "perhaps for certain rites" and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch~ which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.[454]In modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture~[377] a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films.[457] This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter.[458] The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer~ in The Legend of Good Women~ contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages.[459] His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony~ her shining knight engaged in courtly love~ has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.[459]Chaucer highlighted Cleopatra's relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in De Mulieribus Claris and De Casibus Virorum Illustrium~ Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio.[460][394] The Renaissance humanist Bernardino Cacciante [it]~ in his 1504 Libretto apologetico delle donne~ was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works.[461] Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra~ such as the 10th-century Meadows of Gold by Al-Masudi~[462] although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra's suicide.[463]Cleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts~ such as a depiction of her and Antony lying in a Gothic-style tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 1409.[393] In the visual arts~ the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria.[464] Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo~ as well as 15th-century woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccio's works.[465]In the performing arts~ the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603~ and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra~ inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play Cleopatra in 1607.[466] He was followed by William Shakespeare~ whose Antony and Cleopatra~ largely based on Plutarch~ was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England's own Virgin Queen.[467] Cleopatra was also featured in operas~ such as George Frideric Handel's 1724 Giulio Cesare in Egitto~ which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra;[468] Domenico Cimarosa wrote Cleopatra on a similar subject in 1789.[469]In Victorian Britain~ Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products~ including oil lamps~ lithographs~ postcards and cigarettes.[470] Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggard's Cleopatra (1889) and Théophile Gautier's One of Cleopatra's Nights (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner~ while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers's Cleopatra (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy.[470][471] The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra~ while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnand's Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.[472]Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra was considered canonical by the Victorian era.[473] Its popularity led to the perception that the 1885 painting by Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus~ although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria.[474] Also based on Shakespeare's play was Samuel Barber's opera Antony and Cleopatra (1966)~ commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House.[475] In his unfinished 1825 short story The Egyptian Nights~ Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian Aurelius Victor~ previously largely ignored~ that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives.[476][477] Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East~ as the Qing-dynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.[478]Georges Méliès's Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb (French: Cléopâtre)~ an 1899 French silent horror film~ was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra.[479] Hollywood films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media~ which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in Cleopatra (1917)~ Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra (1934)~ and Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra (1963).[480] In addition to her portrayal as a "vampire" queen~ Bara's Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century Orientalist painting~ such as despotic behavior~ mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality.[481] Colbert's character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s~ targeting female moviegoers.[482] In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra~ women's magazines of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup~ clothes~ jewelry~ and hairstyles to achieve the "Egyptian" look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti.[483] By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three films~ two hundred plays and novels~ forty-five operas~ and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.[484]Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media~ important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed~ such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are~ likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD.[485] Ingrid D. Rowland~ who highlights that the "Berenice called Cleopatra" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra.[486] Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings~ such as those preserved by Galen~ including remedies for hair disease~ baldness~ and dandruff~ along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes.[487][18][488] Aëtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra~ while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.[487]Cleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies~[7][490][491][note 80] their European origins tracing back to northern Greece.[492] Through her father~ Ptolemy XII Auletes~ she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter~ founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt~ and Seleucus I Nicator~ the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia.[7][493][494][note 81] While Cleopatra's paternal line can be traced~ the identity of her mother is uncertain.[495][496][497][note 82] She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena~[note 3] the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.[12][496][498][note 83]Cleopatra I Syra was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry.[499][500] Her mother Laodice III was a daughter born to King Mithridates II of Pontus~ a Persian of the Mithridatic dynasty~ and his wife Laodice who had a mixed Greek-Persian heritage.[501] Cleopatra I Syra's father Antiochus III the Great was a descendant of Queen Apama~ the Sogdian Iranian wife of Seleucus I Nicator.[499][500][502][note 84] It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians.[39][503][note 85] Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy~ further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and "would have described herself as Greek."[499][note 86]Stacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry~ arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.[504][note 87] Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek~ half-Egyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship)~[note 88] but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry~ she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.[505][note 89] Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman "but as a civilized Greek."[506]Claims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.[34][507][note 90] Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV~ including Cleopatra~ were illegitimate.[34][507][508] Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC~ a few months after the birth of Cleopatra~ while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.[40] The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry~ of which a reconstruction is shown below.[note 91]The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband~ Ptolemy XII~ but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros~ which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead.[509][34] The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII's wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII's exile in Rome).[56][510]
12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion,Caesarion - Wikipedia,5898,0.0000,Ptolemy XV Caesar[b] (/ˈtɒləmi/; Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Καῖσαρ~ Ptolemaios Kaisar; 23 June 47 BC – 29 August 30 BC)~ nicknamed Caesarion (Greek: Καισαρίων~ Kaisaríōn~ "Little Caesar")~ was the last pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt~ reigning with his mother Cleopatra VII from 2 September 44 BC until her death by 12 August 30 BC~ then as sole ruler until his death was ordered by Octavian (who would become the first Roman emperor as Augustus).Caesarion was the eldest son of Cleopatra and the only known biological son of Julius Caesar~ after whom he was named. He was the last sovereign member of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.Ptolemy Caesar was born in Egypt on 23 June 47 BC. His mother Cleopatra gave him the royal names Theos Philopator Philometor[c] (lit. 'father-loving~ mother-loving God') and insisted that he was the son of Roman politician and dictator Julius Caesar.[3] While he was said to have inherited Caesar's looks and manner~[4] Caesar did not officially acknowledge him.[5][6] All accusations of bastardy against Caesarion were cast from a Roman perspective; their intention was not to portray Caesarion as inappropriate for the throne of Egypt~ but rather to deny that he was Julius' heir by Roman law.[7] One of Caesar's supporters~ Gaius Oppius~ even wrote a pamphlet which attempted to prove that Caesar could not have fathered Caesarion. Nevertheless~ Caesar may have allowed Caesarion to use his name.[8] The matter became contentious when Caesar's adopted son~ Octavian~ came into conflict with Cleopatra.[9]Caesarion spent two of his infant years~ from 46 to 44 BC~ in Rome~ where he and his mother were Caesar's guests at his villa~ Horti Caesaris. Cleopatra hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the Roman Republic~ as well as of Egypt. After Caesar's assassination on 15 March 44 BC~ Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt. Caesarion was named co-ruler by his mother on 2 September 44 BC at the age of three~[10] although he was pharaoh in name only~ with Cleopatra keeping actual authority. Cleopatra compared her relationship to her son with that of the Egyptian goddess Isis and her divine child Horus.[8][11]There is no historical record of Caesarion between 44 BC until the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC. Two years later he also appears at the Donations of Alexandria. Cleopatra and Antony staged both "Donations" to donate lands dominated by Rome and Parthia to Cleopatra's children: Caesarion~ the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II~ and Ptolemy Philadelphus (the last three were his maternal half-siblings fathered by Mark Antony). Octavian gave public approval to the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC~ which have been described as an Antonian strategy to rule the East making use of Cleopatra's unique royal Seleucid lineage in the regions donated.[12]In 34 BC~ Antony granted further eastern lands and titles to Caesarion and his own three children with Cleopatra in the Donations of Alexandria. Caesarion was proclaimed to be a god~ a son of [a] god~ and "King of Kings".[13] This grandiose title was "unprecedented in the management of Roman client-king relationships" and could be seen as "threatening the 'greatness' of the Roman people".[14] Antony also declared Caesarion to be Caesar's true son and heir. This declaration was a direct threat to Octavian (whose claim to power was based on his status as Julius Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son). These proclamations partly caused the fatal breach in Antony's relations with Octavian~ who used Roman resentment over the Donations to gain support for war against Antony and Cleopatra.[15]After the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC~ Cleopatra seems to have groomed Caesarion to take over as "sole ruler without his mother".[8] She may have intended to go into exile~ perhaps with Antony~ who may have hoped that he would be allowed to retire as Lepidus had. Caesarion reappears in the historical record in 30 BC~ when Octavian invaded Egypt and searched for him. Cleopatra may have sent Caesarion~ 17 years old at the time~ to the Red Sea port of Berenice for safety~ possibly as part of plans for an escape to India.[9] Plutarch does say that Caesarion was sent to India~ but also that he was lured back by false promises of the kingdom of Egypt:Caesarion~ who was said to be Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar~ was sent by his mother~ with much treasure~ into India~ by way of Ethiopia. There Rhodon~ another tutor like Theodorus~ persuaded him to go back~ on the ground that [Octavian] Caesar invited him to take the kingdom.[17]Octavian captured the city of Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC~ the date that marks the official annexation of Egypt to the Roman Republic. Around this time Mark Antony and Cleopatra died~ traditionally said to be by suicide~ though murder has been suggested.[18]Octavian may have temporarily considered permitting Caesarion to succeed his mother and rule Egypt (though now a smaller and weaker kingdom)~ however~ he is supposed to have had Caesarion executed in Alexandria on 29 August 30 BC~ following the advice of his companion Arius Didymus~ who said "Too many Caesars is not good"[19] (a pun on a line in Homer).[20][21] Surviving information on the death of Caesarion is scarce.[20] Octavian then assumed absolute control of Egypt. The year 30 BC was considered the first year of the new ruler's reign according to the traditional chronological system of Egypt.[citation needed]Few images of Caesarion survive. He is thought to be depicted in a partial statue found in the harbor of Alexandria in 1997 and is also portrayed twice in relief~ as an adult pharaoh~ with his mother on the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. His infant image appears on some bronze coins of Cleopatra.[27]In addition to his Greek name and nicknames~ Caesarion also had a full set of royal names in the Egyptian language:[28]
13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_Daza,Maximinus Daza - Wikipedia,7512,0.0000,Galerius Valerius Maximinus~ born as Daza[i] (Greek: Μαξιμίνος; 20 November c. 270 – c. July 313)~ was Roman emperor from 310 to 313. He became embroiled in the civil wars of the Tetrarchy between rival claimants for control of the empire~ in which he was defeated by Licinius. A committed pagan~ he engaged in one of the last persecutions of Christians~ before issuing an edict of tolerance near his death.The emperor Maximinus was originally called "Daza"~ an ancient name with various unknown high distinction meanings in Illyria~ where he was born.[4][7] The form "Daia" given by the Christian writer Lactantius~ an important source on the emperor's life~ is considered a misspelling.[8][4] He acquired the name "Maximinus" at the request of his maternal uncle~ Galerius (a Roman emperor of Dacian and Thracian origin)~[9][ii] and his full name as emperor was "Galerius Valerius Maximinus".[11] Modern scholarship often refers to him as "Maximinus Daza"~ though this particular form is not attested by epigraphic or literary evidence.[8][12]He was born in the Roman Illyria region to the sister of emperor Galerius near their family lands around Felix Romuliana~ in Roman Dacia~ a rural area then also in the former Danubian region of Moesia~ now modern Eastern Serbia.[13] He rose to high distinction after joining the Roman Army.[14]In 305~ his maternal uncle Galerius became the eastern Augustus and adopted Maximinus as a son and heir~ raising him to the rank of Caesar (that is~ the junior eastern ruler)~ and granting him the government of Syria and Egypt.[14]In 308~ after the elevation of Licinius to Augustus~ Maximinus and Constantine I were declared filii Augustorum ("sons of the Augusti")~ but Maximinus probably started styling himself as Augustus with support of his troops during a campaign against the Sassanids in 310. On the death of Galerius in 311~ Maximinus divided the Eastern Empire between Licinius and himself. When Licinius and Constantine I began to make common cause~ Maximinus entered into a secret alliance with the usurper Maxentius~ who controlled Italy. He came to an open rupture with Licinius in 313; he summoned an army of 70~000 men but sustained a crushing defeat at the Battle of Tzirallum in the neighbourhood of Heraclea Perinthus on 30 April. He fled~ first to Nicomedia and afterwards to Tarsus~ where he died the following August.[14]Maximinus has a bad name in Christian annals for renewing their persecution after the publication of the Edict of Toleration by Galerius~[14] acting in response to the demands of various urban authorities asking to expel Christians. In one rescript replying to a petition made by the inhabitants of Tyre~ transcribed by Eusebius of Caesarea~[15] Maximinus expounds a pagan orthodoxy~ explaining that it is through "the kindly care of the gods" that one could hope for good crops~ health~ and the peaceful sea~ and that not being the case~ one should blame "the destructive error of the empty vanity of those impious men [that] weighed down the whole world with shame". In one extant inscription (CIL III.12132~ from Arycanda) from the cities of Lycia and Pamphylia asking for the interdiction of the Christians~ Maximinus replied~ in another inscription~ by expressing his hope that "may those [...] who~ after being freed from [...] those by-ways [...] rejoice [as] snatched from a grave illness".[16]After the victory of Constantine over Maxentius~ however~ Maximinus wrote to the Praetorian Prefect Sabinus that it was better to "recall our provincials to the worship of the gods rather by exhortations and flatteries".[17] Eventually~ on the eve of his clash with Licinius~ he accepted Galerius' edict; after being defeated by Licinius~ shortly before his death at Tarsus~ he issued an edict of tolerance on his own~ granting Christians the rights of assembling~ of building churches~ and the restoration of their confiscated properties.[18]As Christianity continued to spread in Egypt~ the title of Pharaoh was increasingly incompatible with the new religious movements. Maximinus's status as a non-Christian accorded the priests of Egypt an opportunity to style him as Pharaoh~ in the same manner that other foreign rulers of Egypt had been styled before. That said~ the Roman emperors themselves mostly ignored the status accorded to them by the Egyptians; and their role as god-kings was only ever acknowledged domestically by the Egyptians themselves.[21] Maximinus would prove to be the last person afforded the title of Pharaoh – no Christian Roman/Byzantine emperor~ nor Islamic or modern leader~ has revived the title since.[21] Maximinus being the last monarch to hold the title of pharaoh~ making his death the end of a 3~400-year-old office.Maximinus' death was variously ascribed "to despair~ to poison~ and to the divine justice".[22]Based on descriptions of his death given by Eusebius~[23] and Lactantius[24] as well as the appearance of Graves' ophthalmopathy in a Tetrarchic statue bust from Anthribis in Egypt sometimes attributed to Maximinus~ endocrinologist Peter D. Papapetrou has advanced a theory that Maximinus may have died from severe thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease.[25]Maximinus was married at the time of his death~ and he left behind an 8 year old son named Maximus and an unnamed 7 year old daughter.[26][27]The Christian writer Eusebius claims that Maximinus was consumed by avarice and superstition. He also allegedly lived a highly dissolute lifestyle:And he went to such an excess of folly and drunkenness that his mind was deranged and crazed in his carousals; and he gave commands when intoxicated of which he repented afterward when sober. He suffered no one to surpass him in debauchery and profligacy~ but made himself an instructor in wickedness to those about him~ both rulers and subjects. He urged on the army to live wantonly in every kind of revelry and intemperance~ and encouraged the governors and generals to abuse their subjects with rapacity and covetousness~ almost as if they were rulers with him. Why need we relate the licentious~ shameless deeds of the man~ or enumerate the multitude with whom he committed adultery? For he could not pass through a city without continually corrupting women and ravishing virgins.[28]According to Eusebius~ only Christians resisted him.For the men endured fire and sword and crucifixion and wild beasts and the depths of the sea~ and cutting off of limbs~ and burnings~ and pricking and digging out of eyes~ and mutilations of the entire body~ and besides these~ hunger and mines and bonds. In all they showed patience in behalf of religion rather than transfer to idols the reverence due to God. And the women were not less manly than the men in behalf of the teaching of the Divine Word~ as they endured conflicts with the men~ and bore away equal prizes of virtue. And when they were dragged away for corrupt purposes~ they surrendered their lives to death rather than their bodies to impurity.He refers to one high-born Christian woman who rejected his advances. He exiled her and seized all of her wealth and assets.[29] Eusebius does not give the girl a name~ but Tyrannius Rufinus calls her "Dorothea~" and writes that she fled to Arabia. This story may have evolved into the legend of Dorothea of Alexandria. Caesar Baronius identified the girl in Eusebius' account with Catherine of Alexandria~ but the Bollandists rejected this theory.[29](See also: Chronological scheme of the Tetrarchy~ 286–324)Notes:Bibliography:
14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_capitals_of_Egypt,List of historical capitals of Egypt - Wikipedia,1096,0.0000,The current capital of Egypt is Cairo. Over the course of its history~ Egypt has had many capitals. Its earliest capital was Tjenu~ better known as Thinis~ which may have been the capital of the hypothetical Thinite Confederacy prior to Egypt's unification. During the First~ Second and Third Intermediate Periods~ Egypt had multiple capitals held by rival dynasties.Thinis was Egypt's first capital following its unification in c. 3100 BCE. The country's current capital is Cairo~ and this has been the case since 972. This makes Cairo Egypt's longest-running capital city~ having retained this status for over 1~050 years under the rule of six dynasties followed by the British protectorate of Egypt and the Republic of Egypt.Alexandria was the second longest-lasting capital of Egypt~ being used for the entirety of the Greco-Roman period~ which lasted for 973 years. Memphis was the capital of Egypt for over 700 years and was the seat of the power for the whole of the Old Kingdom period. Thebes was used as the capital for approximately 485 years~ mostly during the Middle and New Kingdoms.
15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_king,Sacred king - Wikipedia,6120,0.0000,In many historical societies~ the position of kingship carries a sacral meaning; that is~ it is identical with that of a high priest and judge. The concept of theocracy is related~ although a sacred king does not need to necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather~ the temporal position itself has a religious significance behind it.Sir James George Frazer used the concept of the sacred king in his study The Golden Bough (1890–1915)~ the title of which refers to the myth of the Rex Nemorensis.[1] Frazer gives numerous examples~ cited below~ and was an inspiration for the myth and ritual school.[2] However~ "the myth and ritual~ or myth-ritualist~ theory" is disputed;[3] many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common paradigms~ but not that one developed from the other.[4]According to Frazer~ the notion has prehistoric roots and occurs worldwide~ on Java as in sub-Saharan Africa~ with shaman-kings credited with rainmaking and assuring fertility and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people~ meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a human sacrifice~ either killed at the end of his term in the position~ or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the Blót of Domalde).The Ashanti flogged a newly selected king (Ashantehene) before enthroning him. So that he might remember what it felt like to suffer as a man~ to restrain him in his thereafter acquired god-like power~ as the Auriga reminded the conquering hero returning to Rome in his triumph~ the crowd's ecstatic adulation rolling in waves across his ego~ that he remained but a mortal~ and must die.From the Bronze Age in the Near East~ the enthronement and anointment of a monarch is a central religious ritual~ reflected in the titles "Messiah" or "Christ"~ which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus Sargon of Akkad described himself as "deputy of Ishtar"~[citation needed] just as the modern Catholic Pope takes the role of the "Vicar of Christ".[5]Kings are styled as shepherds from earliest times~ e.g.~ the term applied to Sumerian princes such as Lugalbanda in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of leadership and the responsibility to supply food and protection~ as well as superiority.As the mediator between the people and the divine~ the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. Solomon or Gilgamesh) or vision (e.g. via oneiromancy).Study of the concept was introduced by Sir James George Frazer in his influential book The Golden Bough (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in Romanticism and Esotericism (e.g. Julius Evola) and some currents of Neopaganism (Theodism). The school of Pan-Babylonianism derived much of the religion described in the Hebrew Bible from cults of sacral kingship in ancient Babylonia.The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English "myth and ritual school" concentrated on anthropology and folklore~ while the Scandinavian "Uppsala school" emphasized Semitological study.A sacred king~ according to the systematic interpretation of mythology developed by Frazer in The Golden Bough (published 1890)~ was a king who represented a solar deity in a periodically re-enacted fertility rite. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal~ pan-European~ and indeed worldwide fertility myth~ in which a consort for the Goddess was annually replaced. According to Frazer~ the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation~ a divine John Barleycorn.[citation needed] He came into being in the spring~ reigned during the summer~ and ritually died at harvest time~ only to be reborn at the winter solstice to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a "dying and reviving god". Osiris~ Dionysus~ Attis and many other familiar figures from Greek mythology and classical antiquity were re-interpreted in this mold (Osiris in particular is conspicuous in this as he was a figure of Egyptian mythology). The sacred king~ the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god~ was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time~ but whose fate was to suffer as a sacrifice~ to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday~ it launched a cottage industry of amateurs looking for "pagan survivals" in such things as traditional fairs~ maypoles~ and folk arts like morris dancing. It was widely influential in literature~ being alluded to by D. H. Lawrence~ James Joyce~ Ezra Pound~ and in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land~ among other works.Robert Graves used Frazer's work in The Greek Myths and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in The White Goddess~ and in the fictional Seven Days in New Crete he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred king is revived. Margaret Murray~ the principal theorist of witchcraft as a "pagan survival~" used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many kings of England who died as kings~ most notably William Rufus~ were secret pagans and witches~ whose deaths were the re-enactment of the human sacrifice that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth.[6] This idea used by fantasy writer Katherine Kurtz in her novel Lammas Night.Monarchies carried sacral kingship into the Middle Ages~ encouraging the idea of kings installed by the Grace of God. See:Many of Rosemary Sutcliff's novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer~ depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice~ including Sword at Sunset~ The Mark of the Horse Lord~ and Sun Horse~ Moon Horse.[11]In addition to its appearance in her novel Lammas Night noted above~ Katherine Kurtz also uses the idea of sacred kingship in her novel The Quest for Saint Camber.[12]General"English school""Scandinavian school"
16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh,Pharaoh - Wikipedia,19218,0.0000,Pharaoh (/ˈfɛəroʊ/~ US also /ˈfeɪ.roʊ/;[3] Egyptian: pr ꜥꜣ;[note 1] Coptic: ⲡⲣ̄ⲣⲟ~ romanized: Pǝrro; Biblical Hebrew: פַּרְעֹה‎ Parʿō)[4] is the vernacular term often used for the monarchs of ancient Egypt~ who ruled from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Republic in 30 BCE.[5] However~ regardless of gender~ "king" was the term used most frequently by the ancient Egyptians for their monarchs through the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom. The earliest confirmed instances of "pharaoh" used contemporaneously for a ruler were a letter to Akhenaten (reigned c. 1353–1336 BCE) or an inscription possibly referring to Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BCE).In the early dynasties~ ancient Egyptian kings had as many as three titles: the Horus~ the Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj)~ and the Two Ladies or Nebty (nbtj) name.[6] The Golden Horus and the nomen and prenomen titles were added later.[7]In Egyptian society~ religion was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the king was as an intermediary between the deities and the people. The king thus was deputised for the deities in a role that was both as civil and religious administrator. The king owned all of the land in Egypt~ enacted laws~ collected taxes~ and served as commander-in-chief of the military.[8] Religiously~ the king officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. The king was responsible for maintaining Maat (mꜣꜥt)~ or cosmic order~ balance~ and justice~ and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat~ such as to obtain resources.[9]During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt~ the Deshret or the "Red Crown"~ was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt~[10] while the Hedjet~ the "White Crown"~ was worn by the kings of Upper Egypt.[11] After the unification of both kingdoms~ the Pschent~ the combination of both the red and white crowns became the official crown of the pharaoh.[12] With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties such as the Khat~ Nemes~ Atef~ Hemhem crown~ and Khepresh. At times~ a combination of these headdresses or crowns worn together was depicted.The word pharaoh ultimately derives from the Egyptian compound pr ꜥꜣ~ */ˌpaɾuwˈʕaʀ/ "great house"~ written with the two biliteral hieroglyphs pr "house" and ꜥꜣ "column"~ here meaning "great" or "high". It was the title of the royal palace and was used only in larger phrases such as smr pr-ꜥꜣ "Courtier of the High House"~ with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace.[13] From the Twelfth Dynasty onward~ the word appears in a wish formula "Great House~ May it Live~ Prosper~ and be in Health"~ but again only with reference to the royal palace and not a person.Sometime during the era of the New Kingdom~ pharaoh became the form of address for a person who was king. The earliest confirmed instance where pr ꜥꜣ is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to the eighteenth dynasty king~ Akhenaten (reigned c. 1353–1336 BCE)~ that is addressed to "Great House~ L~ W~ H~ the Lord".[14][15] However~ there is a possibility that the title pr ꜥꜣ first might have been applied personally to Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BCE)~ depending on whether an inscription on the Temple of Armant may be confirmed to refer to that king.[16] During the Eighteenth dynasty (sixteenth to fourteenth centuries BCE) the title pharaoh was employed as a reverential designation of the ruler. About the late Twenty-first Dynasty (tenth century BCE)~ however~ instead of being used alone and originally just for the palace~ it began to be added to the other titles before the name of the king~ and from the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty (eighth to seventh centuries BCE~ during the declining Third Intermediate Period) it was~ at least in ordinary use~ the only epithet prefixed to the royal appellative.[17]From the Nineteenth dynasty onward pr-ꜥꜣ on its own~ was used as regularly as ḥm~ "Majesty".[18] The term~ therefore~ evolved from a word specifically referring to a building to a respectful designation for the ruler presiding in that building~ particularly by the time of the Twenty-Second Dynasty and Twenty-third Dynasty.[citation needed]The first dated appearance of the title "pharaoh" being attached to a ruler's name occurs in Year 17 of Siamun (tenth century BCE) on a fragment from the Karnak Priestly Annals~ a religious document. Here~ an induction of an individual to the Amun priesthood is dated specifically to the reign of "Pharaoh Siamun".[19] This new practice was continued under his successor~ Psusennes II~ and the subsequent kings of the twenty-second dynasty. For instance~ the Large Dakhla stela is specifically dated to Year 5 of king "Pharaoh Shoshenq~ beloved of Amun"~ whom all Egyptologists concur was Shoshenq I—the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty—including Alan Gardiner in his original 1933 publication of this stela.[20] Shoshenq I was the second successor of Siamun. Meanwhile~ the traditional custom of referring to the sovereign as~ pr-ˤ3~ continued in official Egyptian narratives.[citation needed]The title is reconstructed to have been pronounced *[parʕoʔ] in the Late Egyptian language~ from which the Greek historian Herodotus derived the name of one of the Egyptian kings~ Koinē Greek: Φερων.[21] In the Hebrew Bible~ the title also occurs as Hebrew: פרעה [parʕoːh];[22] from that~ in the Septuagint~ Koinē Greek: φαραώ~ romanized: pharaō~ and then in Late Latin pharaō~ both -n stem nouns. The Qur'an likewise spells it Arabic: فرعون firʿawn with n (here~ always referring to the one evil king in the Book of Exodus story~ by contrast to the good king in surah Yusuf's story). The Arabic combines the original ayin from Egyptian along with the -n ending from Greek.In English~ the term was at first spelled "Pharao"~ but the translators for the King James Bible revived "Pharaoh" with "h" from the Hebrew. Meanwhile~ in Egypt~ *[par-ʕoʔ] evolved into Sahidic Coptic ⲡⲣ̅ⲣⲟ pərro and then ərro by rebracketing p- as the definite article "the" (from ancient Egyptian pꜣ).[23]Other notable epithets are nswt~ translated to "king"; ḥm~ "Majesty"; jty for "monarch or sovereign"; nb for "lord";[18][note 2] and ḥqꜣ for "ruler".As a central figure of the state~ the pharaoh is the obligatory intermediary between the gods and humans. To the former~ he ensured the proper performance of rituals in the temples; to the latter~ he guaranteed agricultural prosperity~ the defense of the territory and impartial justice.In the sanctuaries~ the image of the sovereign is omnipresent through parietal scenes and statues. In this iconography~ the pharaoh is invariably represented as the equal of the gods. In the religious speech~ he is however only their humble servant~ a zealous servant who makes multiple offerings. This piety expresses the hope of a just return of service. Filled with goods~ the gods must favorably activate the forces of nature for a common benefit to all Egyptians. The only human being admitted to dialogue with the gods on an equal level~ Pharaoh is the supreme officiant; the first of the priests of the country. More widely~ the pharaonic gesture covers all the fields of activity of the collective and ignores the separation of powers. Also~ every member of the administration acts only in the name of the royal person~ by delegation of power.From the Pyramid Texts~ the political actions of the sovereign are framed by a single maxim: "Bring Maat and repel Isfet"~ that is to say~ promote harmony and repel chaos. As the nurturing father of the people~ Pharaoh ensures prosperity by calling upon the gods to regulate the waters of the Nile~ by opening the granaries in case of famine and by guaranteeing a good distribution of arable land. Chief of the armies~ the pharaoh is the brave protector of the borders. Like Ra who fights the serpent Apophis~ the king of Egypt repels the plunderers of the desert~ fights the invading armies and defeats the internal rebels. Pharaoh is always the sole victor; standing up and knocking out a bunch of prisoners or shooting arrows from his battle chariot. As the only legislator~ the laws and decrees he promulgates are inspired by divine wisdom. This legislation~ kept in the archives and placed under the responsibility of the vizier~ applies to all~ for the common good and social agreement.Sceptres and staves were a general symbol of authority in ancient Egypt.[24] One of the earliest royal scepters was discovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwy in Abydos.[24] Kings were also known to carry a staff~ and Anedjib is shown on stone vessels carrying a so-called mks-staff.[25] The scepter with the longest history seems to be the heqa-sceptre~ sometimes described as the shepherd's crook.[26] The earliest examples of this piece of regalia dates to prehistoric Egypt. A scepter was found in a tomb at Abydos that dates to Naqada III.Another scepter associated with the king is the was-sceptre.[26] This is a long staff mounted with an animal head. The earliest known depictions of the was-scepter date to the First Dynasty. The was-scepter is shown in the hands of both kings and deities.The flail later was closely related to the heqa-scepter (the crook and flail)~ but in early representations the king was also depicted solely with the flail~ as shown in a late pre-dynastic knife handle that is now in the Metropolitan museum~ and on the Narmer Macehead.[27]The earliest evidence known of the Uraeus—a rearing cobra—is from the reign of Den from the first dynasty. The cobra supposedly protected the king by spitting fire at its enemies.[28]The red crown of Lower Egypt~ the Deshret crown~ dates back to pre-dynastic times and symbolised chief ruler. A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from Naqada~ and later~ Narmer is shown wearing the red crown on both the Narmer Macehead and the Narmer Palette.The white crown of Upper Egypt~ the Hedjet~ was worn in the Predynastic Period by Scorpion II~ and~ later~ by Narmer.This is the combination of the Deshret and Hedjet crowns into a double crown~ called the Pschent crown. It is first documented in the middle of the First Dynasty of Egypt. The earliest depiction may date to the reign of Djet~ and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den.[30]The khat headdress consists of a kind of "kerchief" whose end is tied similarly to a ponytail. The earliest depictions of the khat headdress comes from the reign of Den~ but is not found again until the reign of Djoser.The Nemes headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of royal headgear depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown~ apart from the Khat headdress~ has been commonly depicted on top of the Nemes. The statue from his Serdab in Saqqara shows the king wearing the nemes headdress.[30]Osiris is shown to wear the Atef crown~ which is an elaborate Hedjet with feathers and disks. Depictions of kings wearing the Atef crown originate from the Old Kingdom.The Hemhem crown is usually depicted on top of Nemes~ Pschent~ or Deshret crowns. It is an ornate~ triple Atef with corkscrew sheep horns and usually two uraei. The depiction of this crown begins among New Kingdom rulers during the Early Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.Also called the blue crown~ the Khepresh crown has been depicted in art since the New Kingdom. It is often depicted being worn in battle~ but it was also frequently worn during ceremonies. It used to be called a war crown by many~ but modern historians refrain from defining it thus.Egyptologist Bob Brier has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits~ no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. The tomb of Tutankhamun that was discovered largely intact~ contained such royal regalia as a crook and flail~ but no crown was found among his funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered.[31] It is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties and were used in rituals. Brier's speculation is that crowns were religious or state items~ so a dead king likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor~ much as the crowns of modern monarchies.[32]During the Early Dynastic Period kings had three titles. The Horus name is the oldest and dates to the late pre-dynastic period. The Nesu Bity name was added during the First Dynasty. The Nebty name (Two Ladies) was first introduced toward the end of the First Dynasty.[30] The Golden falcon (bik-nbw) name is not well understood. The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a cartouche.[33] By the Middle Kingdom~ the official titulary of the ruler consisted of five names; Horus~ Nebty~ Golden Horus~ nomen~ and prenomen [34] for some rulers~ only one or two of them may be known.The Horus name was adopted by the king~ when taking the throne. The name was written within a square frame representing the palace~ named a serekh. The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king Ka~ before the First Dynasty.[35] The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with Horus. Aha refers to "Horus the fighter"~ Djer refers to "Horus the strong"~ etc. Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names. Khasekhemwy refers to "Horus: the two powers are at peace"~ while Nebra refers to "Horus~ Lord of the Sun".[30]The Nesu Bity name~ also known as prenomen~ was one of the new developments from the reign of Den. The name would follow the glyphs for the "Sedge and the Bee". The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The nsw bity name may have been the birth name of the king. It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists.[30]The earliest example of a Nebty (Two Ladies) name comes from the reign of king Aha from the First Dynasty. The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt~ Nekhbet and Wadjet.[30][33] The title is preceded by the vulture (Nekhbet) and the cobra (Wadjet) standing on a basket (the neb sign).[30]The Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or nbw sign. The title may have represented the divine status of the king. The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the pyramids and obelisks are representations of (golden) sun-rays. The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt~ the city of Set. This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set.[30]The prenomen and nomen were contained in a cartouche. The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (nsw bity) or Lord of the Two Lands (nebtawy) title. The prenomen often incorporated the name of Re. The nomen often followed the title~ Son of Re (sa-ra)~ or the title~ Lord of Appearances (neb-kha).[33]In Ancient Egypt~ the Pharaoh was often considered to be divine. This precept originated before 3000 BCE and the Egyptian office of divine kingship would go on to influence many other societies and kingdoms~ surviving into the modern era. The Pharaoh also became a mediator between the gods and man. This institution represents an innovation over that of Sumerian city-states where~ though the clan leader or king mediated between his people and the gods~ did not himself represent a god on Earth. The few Sumerian exceptions to this would post-date the origins of this practice in ancient Egypt. For example~ the legendary king Gilgamesh~ thought to have reigned in Uruk as a contemporary of the Egyptian ruler Djoser~ was cast as having had his mother as the Mesopotamian goddess Ninsun alongside his father~ the previous human ruler of Uruk. Another Mesopotamian example of a god-king was Naram-Sin of Akkad. During the Early Dynastic Period~ the Pharaoh was represented as the divine incarnation of Horus~ and the unifier of Upper and Lower Egypt. By the time of Djedefre (26th century BCE)~ the Pharaoh also ceased to have a father~ as his mother was magically impregnated by the solar deity Ra. According to Pyramid Text Utterance 571~ "... the King was fashioned by his father Atum before the sky existed~ before earth existed~ before men existed~ before the gods were born~ before death existed ..." According to an inscription on the statue of Horemheb (14th–13th centuries BCE): "he [Horemheb] already came out of his mother's bosom adorned with the prestige and the divine color ..."[36] Inscriptions regularly described the Pharaoh as the "good god" or "perfect god" (nfr ntr). By the time of the New Kingdom~ the divinity of the king was imbued as he possessed the manifestation of the god Amun-Re; this was referred to as his 'living royal ka' which he received during the coronation ceremony. The divinity of Pharaoh was still held to during the period of Persian domination of Egypt. The Persian emperor Darius the Great (522–486 BCE) was referred to as a divine being in Egyptian temple texts. Such descriptions continued and were designated to Alexander the Great after his conquest of Egypt~ and later still for the rulers of the Ptolemaic Kingdom that succeeded Alexander's rule.[37]Descriptions of the divinity of the Pharaoh are much more infrequent in sources from Classical Greece. One Ptolemaic-era hymn describes the divinity of the Pharaoh~ though this may reflect Greek notions of divine kingship just as much as it could reflect Egyptian ones. The historian Herodotus explicitly denies this~ claiming that Egyptian priests rejected any notion of the divinity of the king. The only explicit classical Greek source which describes the divinity of Pharaoh is contained in the writings of Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BCE~ who in turn relies on Hecataeus of Abdera as his source of information. Diodorus slightly contradicts himself in a different passage where he asserts that Darius I was the first ruler of Egypt to be honored as a king.[37]Even after the reign of the Egyptian kings and pharaohs~ the notion of Pharaoh's self-notion as a divine being survived and is described in rabbinic literature. In these sources~ the Pharaoh is described as hubristically asserting his own divinity and yet~ compared to the one true God~ is no more than an impotent human. Genesis Rabbah 89:3 invokes Pharaoh describing himself as the god over the Nile river. In Exodus Rabbah 10:2~ Pharaoh boasts that he is the creator and owner of the Nile. God is then said to have responded to this statement by challenging the Pharaoh over who owns the Nile~ as God proceeds to create a disaster by bringing forth frogs from it that consume Egypt's agriculture. In other midrashic texts~ Pharaoh asserts himself as the creator of the universe and even of himself.[38] In the Tanhuma~ in commentary on Ezekiel 29:9~ Pharaoh is said to have proclaimed himself as lord of the universe. Pharaoh is represented as a heretical figure who presents himself as divine~ and these texts then claim that his claims were exposed when he had to go to the Nile to relieve himself.[39]
17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Egypt,Early Dynastic Period (Egypt) - Wikipedia,7688,0.0000,The Early Dynastic Period~ also known as Archaic Period or the Thinite Period (from Thinis~ the hometown of its rulers)~[1] is the era of ancient Egypt that immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in c. 3150 BC. It is generally taken to include the First Dynasty and the Second Dynasty~ lasting from the end of the archaeological culture of Naqada III until c. 2686 BC~ or the beginning of the Old Kingdom.[2] With the First Dynasty~ the Egyptian capital moved from Thinis to Memphis~ with the unified land being ruled by an Egyptian god-king. In the south~ Abydos remained the major centre of ancient Egyptian religion; the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization~ such as Egyptian art~ Egyptian architecture~ and many aspects of Egyptian religion~ took shape during the Early Dynastic Period.Before the unification of Egypt~ the land was settled with autonomous villages. With the early dynasties~ and for much of Egypt's history thereafter~ the country came to be known as "The Two Lands" (referencing Upper and Lower Egypt). The pharaohs established a national administration and appointed royal governors~ and buildings of the central government were typically open-air temples constructed of wood or sandstone. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs appear just before this period~ though little is known of the spoken language that they represent.By about 3600 BC~ Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.[3] Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization.[4] A new and distinctive pottery~ which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant~ appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this period.[4] The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks~ and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular.[4]Concurrent with these cultural advances~ a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River~ or Upper Egypt~ occurred. At the same time~ the societies of the Nile Delta~ or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process.[4] Warfare between Upper and Lower Egypt occurred often.[4] During his reign in Upper Egypt~ King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule.[5] Narmer is shown on palettes wearing the double crown~ composed of the lotus flower representing Upper Egypt and the papyrus reed representing Lower Egypt - a sign of the unified rule of both parts of Egypt which was followed by all succeeding rulers. In mythology~ the unification of Egypt is portrayed as the falcon-god~ called Horus and identified with Lower Egypt~ as conquering and subduing the god Set~ who was identified with Upper Egypt.[6] Divine kingship~ which would persist in Egypt for the next three millennia~ was firmly established as the basis of Egypt's government.[7] The unification of societies along the Nile has also been linked to the end of the African humid period.[citation needed]Funeral practices for the peasants would have been the same as in predynastic times~ but the rich demanded something more. Thus~ the Egyptians began construction of the mastabas which became models for the later Old Kingdom constructions such as the step pyramid. Cereal agriculture and centralization contributed to the success of the state for the next 800 years.It seems certain that Egypt became unified as a cultural and economic domain long before its first king ascended to the throne in the lower Egyptian city of Memphis. Political unification proceeded gradually~ perhaps over a period of a few centuries~ as local districts established trading networks and as the ability of their governments to organize agriculture labor on a larger scale increased. Divine kingship may also have gained spiritual momentum as the cults of gods like Horus~ Set and Neith associated with living representatives became widespread in the country.[8]It was also during this period that the Egyptian writing system was further developed. Initially~ Egyptian writing had been composed primarily of a few symbols denoting amounts of various substances. By the end of the 3rd dynasty it had been expanded to include more than 200 symbols~ both phonograms and ideograms.[7] In all likelihood~ Naqada III saw the earliest codification of signs~ where royal serekhs—a rectangular cartouche representing the niched or gated façade of a palace surmounted by the Horus falcon—are also first seen~ painted on jars and impressed on their sealings. These goods were often traded "abroad through the northern Sinai to southern Palestine."[9]According to Manetho~ the first monarch of the unified Upper and Lower Egypt was Menes~ who is now identified with Narmer. Indeed~ Narmer is the earliest recorded First Dynasty monarch. Narmer appears first on the necropolis seal impressions of Den and Qa'a.[10][11][12] This shows that Narmer was recognized by the first dynasty kings as an important founding figure. Narmer is also the earliest king associated to the symbols of power over the two lands (see in particular the Narmer Palette~ a votive cosmetic palette showing Narmer wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt) and may therefore be the first king to achieve the unification. Consequently~ the current consensus is that "Menes" and "Narmer" refer to the same person.[4] Alternative theories hold that Narmer was the final king of the Naqada III period[6] and Hor-Aha is to be identified with "Menes".Egyptian settlement and colonization are attested from about 3200 BC onward all over the area of southern Canaan with almost every type of artifact: architecture (fortifications~ embankments and buildings)~ pottery~ vessels~ tools~ weapons~ seals~ etc.[13][14][15][16] 20 serekhs attributed to Narmer — the first ruler of the Early Dynastic Period — have been found in Canaan.[17] There is also evidence of Egyptian settlement and occupation in lower Nubia after the Nubian A-Group culture came to an end.[18][19] By the Early Dynastic Period~ the Egyptian state had likely imposed its authority as far north as modern Tel Aviv and as far south as the second cataract in Nubia.[20](Shamshi-Adad dynasty 1808–1736 BCE) (Amorites) Shamshi-Adad I Ishme-Dagan I Mut-Ashkur Rimush Asinum Ashur-dugul Ashur-apla-idi Nasir-Sin Sin-namir Ipqi-Ishtar Adad-salulu Adasi (Non-dynastic usurpers 1735–1701 BCE) Puzur-Sin Ashur-dugul Ashur-apla-idi Nasir-Sin Sin-namir Ipqi-Ishtar Adad-salulu Adasi (Adaside dynasty 1700–722 BCE) Bel-bani Libaya Sharma-Adad I Iptar-Sin Bazaya Lullaya Shu-Ninua Sharma-Adad II Erishum III Shamshi-Adad II Ishme-Dagan II Shamshi-Adad III Ashur-nirari I Puzur-Ashur III Enlil-nasir I Nur-ili Ashur-shaduni Ashur-rabi I Ashur-nadin-ahhe I Enlil-Nasir II Ashur-nirari II Ashur-bel-nisheshu Ashur-rim-nisheshu Ashur-nadin-ahhe IISecond Intermediate Period Sixteenth Dynasty Abydos Dynasty Seventeenth Dynasty(1500–1100 BCE) Kidinuid dynasty Igehalkid dynasty Untash-NapirishaTwenty-first Dynasty of Egypt Smendes Amenemnisu Psusennes I Amenemope Osorkon the Elder Siamun Psusennes IITwenty-third Dynasty of Egypt Harsiese A Takelot II Pedubast I Shoshenq VI Osorkon III Takelot III Rudamun Menkheperre Ini Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt Tefnakht Bakenranef(Sargonid dynasty) Tiglath-Pileser† Shalmaneser† Marduk-apla-iddina II Sargon† Sennacherib† Marduk-zakir-shumi II Marduk-apla-iddina II Bel-ibni Ashur-nadin-shumi† Nergal-ushezib Mushezib-Marduk Esarhaddon† Ashurbanipal Ashur-etil-ilani Sinsharishkun Sin-shumu-lishir Ashur-uballit II
18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt,New Kingdom of Egypt - Wikipedia,15037,0.0000,The New Kingdom~ also referred to as the Egyptian Empire~ was the ancient Egyptian nation between the 16th century BC and the 11th century BC. This period of ancient Egyptian history covers the Eighteenth~ Nineteenth~ and Twentieth Dynasties. Through radiocarbon dating~ the establishment of the New Kingdom has been placed between 1570 BC and 1544 BC.[3] The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period. It was the most prosperous time for the Egyptian people and marked the peak of Egypt's power.[4]In 1845~ the concept of a "New Kingdom" as one of three "golden ages" was coined by German scholar Baron von Bunsen; the original definition would evolve significantly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.[5] The later part of this period~ under the Nineteenth Dynasty (1295–1189 BC) and the Twentieth Dynasty (1189–1069 BC)~ is also known as the Ramesside period. It is named after the eleven pharaohs who took the name Ramesses~ after Ramesses I~ the founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty~ and his grandson Ramesses II~ its longest-reigning monarch.[4]Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period~ the New Kingdom saw a historic expansion into the Levant~ thus marking Egypt's greatest territorial extent. Similarly~ in response to attacks by the Kushites~ who led raids into Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period~[6][7] the rulers of the New Kingdom felt compelled to expand far into Nubia and to hold wider territories in the Near East~ particularly on the Levantine frontier.The Eighteenth Dynasty included some of Egypt's most famous kings~ including Ahmose I~ Hatshepsut~ Thutmose III~ Amenhotep III~ Akhenaten~ and Tutankhamun.Ahmose I is viewed to be the founder of the eighteenth dynasty. He continued the campaigns of his father Seqenenre Tao and of Kamose against the Hyksos until he reunified the country once more. Ahmose would then continue to campaign in the Levant~ the home of the Hyksos~ to prevent any future invasions on Egypt.[8]Ahmose was followed by Amenhotep I~ who campaigned in Nubia and was followed by Thutmose I. Thutmose I campaigned in the Levant and reached as far as the Euphrates~ thus becoming the first pharaoh to cross the river.[9] During this campaign~ the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose. However~ after he returned~ they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions.[10]Hatshepsut was one of the most powerful pharaohs of this dynasty. She was the daughter of Thutmose I and the royal wife of Thutmose II. Upon the death of her husband~ she ruled jointly with his son by a minor wife~ Thutmose III~ who had ascended to the throne as a child of about two years of age~ but eventually she ruled in her own right as king. Hatshepsut built extensively in the Karnak temple in Luxor and throughout all of Egypt[11] and she re-established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos rule of Lower Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period~ thereby building the wealth of the Eighteenth Dynasty. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. After her death~ having gained valuable experience heading up the military for Hatshepsut~ Thutmose III assumed rule.Thutmose III expanded Egypt's army and wielded it with great success to consolidate the empire created by his predecessors. This resulted in a peak in Egypt's power and wealth during the reign of Amenhotep III. The term pharaoh~ originally the name of the king's palace~ became a form of address for the person who was king during his reign (c. 1479–1425 BC).[12]Widely considered a military genius by historians~ Thutmose III conducted at least 16 campaigns in 20 years.[13] He was an active expansionist ruler.[14] He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates~ doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. He continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish and quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats~ taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise.[15]The wealthiest of all the kings of this dynasty is Amenhotep III~ who built the Luxor Temple~ the Precinct of Monthu at Karnak and his massive Mortuary Temple. Amenhotep III also built the Malkata palace~ the largest built in Egypt.One of the best-known eighteenth dynasty pharaohs is Amenhotep IV~ who changed his name to Akhenaten in honour of the Aten~ a representation of the Egyptian god~ Ra. His worship of the Aten as his personal deity is often interpreted as history's first instance of monotheism. Akhenaten's wife~ Nefertiti~ contributed a great deal to his new direction in the Egyptian religion. Nefertiti was bold enough to perform rituals to Aten. Akhenaten's religious fervour is cited as the reason why he and his wife were subsequently written out of Egyptian history.[16] Under his reign~ in the fourteenth century BC~ Egyptian art flourished in a distinctive new style (see Amarna Period).By the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty~ Egypt's status had changed radically. Aided by Akhenaten's apparent lack of interest in international affairs~ the Hittites had gradually extended their influence into the Levant to become a major power in international politics—a power that both Seti I and his son Ramesses II would confront during the nineteenth Dynasty.The last two members of the Eighteenth Dynasty—Ay and Horemheb—became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court~ although Ay might also have been the maternal uncle of Akhenaten and a fellow descendant of Yuya and Tjuyu.Ay may have married the widowed Great Royal Wife and young half-sister of Tutankhamun~ Ankhesenamun~ in order to obtain power; she did not live long afterward. Ay then married Tey~ who originally~ had been wet-nurse to Nefertiti.Ay's reign was short. His successor was Horemheb~ a general during the reign of Tutankhamun~ whom the pharaoh may have intended as his successor in the event that he had no surviving children~ which came to pass.[17] Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup d'état. Although Ay's son or stepson Nakhtmin was named as his father or stepfather's Crown Prince~ Nakhtmin seems to have died during the reign of Ay~ leaving the opportunity for Horemheb to claim the throne next.Horemheb also died without surviving children~ having appointed his vizier~ Pa-ra-mes-su~ as his heir. This vizier ascended the throne in 1292 BC as Ramesses I~ and was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty.The Nineteenth Dynasty was founded by the Vizier Ramesses I~ whom the last ruler of the eighteenth dynasty~ Pharaoh Horemheb~ had chosen as his successor. His brief reign marked a transition period between the reign of Horemheb and the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty~ in particular~ his son Seti I and grandson Ramesses II~ who would bring Egypt to new heights of imperial power.Seti I fought a series of wars in western Asia~ Libya~ and Nubia in the first decade of his reign. The main source for knowledge of Seti's military activities are his battle scenes on the north exterior wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall~ along with several royal stelas with inscriptions mentioning battles in Canaan and Nubia. The greatest achievement of Seti I's foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. Seti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town and erected a victory stela at the site which has been found by archaeologists.[18] Kadesh~ however~ soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru which were close to the Hittite homelands.Ramesses II sought to recover territories in the Levant that had been held by the 18th Dynasty. In his second year~ before confronting the Hittites~ Ramesses II had to deal with a raid by the Sherden sea people whom he defeated and incorporated into his army.[19] His campaigns against the Hittites culminated in the Battle of Kadesh~ where he led Egyptian armies against those of the Hittite king Muwatalli II. Ramesses was caught in history's first recorded military ambush~ although he was able to rally his troops and turn the tide of battle against the Hittites thanks to the arrival of the Ne'arin (possibly mercenaries in the employ of Egypt). The outcome of the battle was undecided~ with both sides claiming victory at their home front~ and ultimately resulting in a peace treaty between the two nations. He campaigned later in the Levant capturing Edom and Moab.[20] New kingdom Egyptian stelae from this period have been found in Jordan.[21] Later~ Egyptians conquered Qatna and Tunip where a statue of Ramses II was erected.[22] Thus he recaptured Qadesh and northern Amurru.[23] Nevertheless~ like Seti I~ he found that he could not permanently hold territory so far from base and after years of conflict~ a peace treaty was concluded between the two nations. Egypt was able to obtain wealth and stability under the rule of Ramesses~ for more than half a century.[24] His immediate successors continued the military campaigns~ although an increasingly troubled court—which at one point put a usurper (Amenmesse) on the throne—made it increasingly difficult for a pharaoh to effectively retain control of the territories.Ramesses II built extensively throughout Egypt and Nubia~ and his cartouches are prominently displayed~ even in buildings that he did not construct.[25] There are accounts of his honor hewn on stone~ statues~ and the remains of palaces and temples—most notably the Ramesseum in western Thebes and the rock temples of Abu Simbel. He covered the land from the Delta to Nubia with buildings in a way no king before him had.[26] He also founded a new capital city in the Delta during his reign~ called Pi-Ramesses. It previously had served as a summer palace during the reign of Seti I.[27]Ramesses II constructed many large monuments~ including the archaeological complex of Abu Simbel~ and the Mortuary temple known as the Ramesseum. He built on a monumental scale to ensure that his legacy would survive the ravages of time. Ramesses used art as a means of propaganda for his victories over foreigners~ which are depicted on numerous temple reliefs. Ramesses II erected more colossal statues of himself than any other pharaoh~ and also usurped many existing statues by inscribing his own cartouche on them.Ramesses II was also famed for the huge number of children he sired by his various wives and concubines; the tomb he built for his sons (many of whom he outlived) in the Valley of the Kings has proven to be the largest funerary complex in Egypt.The immediate successors of Ramesses II continued the military campaigns although an increasingly troubled court complicated matters. He was succeeded by his son Merneptah and then by Merneptah's son Seti II. Seti II's right to the throne seems to have been disputed by his half-brother Amenmesse~ who may have temporarily ruled from Thebes.Upon his death~ Seti II's son Siptah~ who may have been afflicted with poliomyelitis during his life~ was appointed to the throne by Bay~ a chancellor and a West Asian commoner who served as vizier behind the scenes. Siptah died early and throne was assumed by Twosret~ who was the royal wife of his father and~ possibly~ his uncle Amenmesse's sister.A period of anarchy at the end of Twosret's short reign saw the enthronement of Setnakhte~ establishing the Twentieth Dynasty.The last "great" pharaoh from the New Kingdom is widely considered to be Ramesses III~ a Twentieth Dynasty pharaoh who reigned several decades after Ramesses II.[28]In the eighth year of his reign~ the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles (the Battle of Djahy and the Battle of the Delta). He incorporated them as subject peoples and is thought to have settled them in Southern Canaan~ although there is evidence that they forced their way into Canaan. Their presence in Canaan may have contributed to the formation of new states~ such as Philistia~ in this region after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire (In the reign of Ramses III himself~ Egyptian presence in the Levant is still attested as far as Byblos[29][30]). He later was compelled to fight invading Libyan tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt's Western Delta in his sixth year and eleventh year respectively.[31]The heavy cost of this warfare slowly drained Egypt's treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of the difficulties is indicated by the fact that the first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during the twenty-ninth year of Ramesses III's reign. At that time~ the food rations for Egypt's favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Deir el Medina could not be provisioned.[32] Air pollution limited the amount of sunlight penetrating the atmosphere~ affecting agricultural production and arresting global tree growth for almost two full decades~ until 1140 BC.[33] One proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption of the Hekla volcano in Iceland~ but the dating of this remains disputed.Near the end of Ramesses III's reign~ one of his secondary wives plotted to assassinate the king in her quest to place her son on the throne. Palace personnel~ the harem~ government officials~ and army officers participated in the plot. A special court of 12 judges was formed to try the defendants who were sentenced to death. Written sources show that the coup failed and that the conspirators were successfully tried. However~ it is not clear from the documents whether Ramses survived the assassination attempt. The king's mummy showed no visible wounds~ and questions about his fate were left open to speculation for many years. In 2012~ researchers announced that a CT scan had revealed a deep knife wound in the mummy's throat~ indicating that Ramesses was indeed killed by the conspirators. He died in Thebes in the 32nd year of his reign and was succeeded by Crown Prince Ramesses IV.[34]Ramesses III's death was followed by years of bickering among his heirs. Three of his sons ascended the throne successively as Ramesses IV~ Rameses VI~ and Rameses VIII. Egypt was increasingly beset by droughts~ below-normal flooding of the Nile~ famine~ civil unrest~ and corruption of officials. The power of the last pharaoh of the dynasty~ Ramesses XI~ grew so weak that in the south the High Priests of Amun at Thebes became the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt~ and Smendes controlled Lower Egypt in the north~ even before Rameses XI's death. Smendes eventually founded the twenty-first dynasty at Tanis.
19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt,Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt - Wikipedia,7828,0.0000,The Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt (notated Dynasty XVIII~ alternatively 18th Dynasty or Dynasty 18) is classified as the first dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt~ the era in which ancient Egypt achieved the peak of its power. The Eighteenth Dynasty spanned the period from 1550/1549 to 1292 BC. This dynasty is also known as the Thutmoside Dynasty[1]: 156 ) for the four pharaohs named Thutmose.Several of Egypt's most famous pharaohs were from the Eighteenth Dynasty~ including Tutankhamun~ whose tomb was found by Howard Carter in 1922. Other famous pharaohs of the dynasty include Hatshepsut (c. 1479 BC–1458 BC)~ the longest-reigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty~ and Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC)~ the "heretic pharaoh"~ with his Great Royal Wife~ Nefertiti. The Eighteenth Dynasty is unique among Egyptian dynasties in that it had two queens regnant~ women who ruled as sole pharaoh: Hatshepsut and Neferneferuaten~ usually identified as Nefertiti.[2]Dynasty XVIII was founded by Ahmose I~ the brother or son of Kamose~ the last ruler of the 17th Dynasty. Ahmose finished the campaign to expel the Hyksos rulers. His reign is seen as the end of the Second Intermediate Period and the start of the New Kingdom. Ahmose's consort~ Queen Ahmose-Nefertari was "arguably the most venerated woman in Egyptian history~ and the grandmother of the 18th Dynasty."[3] She was deified after she died. Ahmose was succeeded by his son~ Amenhotep I~ whose reign was relatively uneventful.[4]Amenhotep I probably left no male heir and the next pharaoh~ Thutmose I~ seems to have been related to the royal family through marriage. During his reign~ the borders of Egypt's empire reached their greatest expanse~ extending in the north to Carchemish on the Euphrates and in the south up to Kanisah Kurgus beyond the fourth cataract of the Nile. Thutmose I was succeeded by Thutmose II and his queen~ Hatshepsut~ who was the daughter of Thutmose I. After her husband's death and a period of regency for her minor stepson (who would later become pharaoh as Thutmose III) Hatshepsut became pharaoh in her own right and ruled for over twenty years.Thutmose III~ who became known as the greatest military pharaoh ever~ also had a lengthy reign after becoming pharaoh. He had a second co-regency in his old age with his son Amenhotep II. Amenhotep II was succeeded by Thutmose IV~ who in his turn was followed by his son Amenhotep III~ whose reign is seen as a high point in this dynasty.Amenhotep III's reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity~ artistic splendor~ and international power~ as attested by over 250 statues (more than any other pharaoh) and 200 large stone scarabs discovered from Syria to Nubia.[5] Amenhotep III undertook large scale building programmes~ the extent of which can only be compared with those of the much longer reign of Ramesses II during Dynasty XIX.[6] Amenhotep III's consort was the Great Royal Wife Tiye~ for whom he built an artificial lake~ as described on eleven scarabs.[7]Amenhotep III may have shared the throne for up to twelve years with his son Amenhotep IV. There is much debate about this proposed co-regency~ with different experts considering that there was a lengthy co-regency~ a short one~ or none at all.In the fifth year of his reign~ Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (ꜣḫ-n-jtn~ "Effective for the Aten") and moved his capital to Amarna~ which he named Akhetaten. During the reign of Akhenaten~ the Aten (jtn~ the sun disk) became~ first~ the most prominent deity~ and eventually came to be considered the only god.[8] Whether this amounted to true monotheism continues to be the subject of debate within the academic community. Some state that Akhenaten created a monotheism~ while others point out that he merely suppressed a dominant solar cult by the assertion of another~ while he never completely abandoned several other traditional deities.Later Egyptians considered this "Amarna Period" an unfortunate aberration. After his death~ Akhenaten was succeeded by two short-lived pharaohs~ Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten~ of which little is known. In 1334 Akhenaten's son~ Tutankhaten~ ascended to the throne: shortly after~ he restored Egyptian polytheist cult and subsequently changed his name in Tutankhamun~ in honor to the Egyptian god Amun.[9] His infant daughters~ 317a and 317b mummies~ represent the final genetically related generation of the Eighteenth Dynasty.The last two members of the Eighteenth Dynasty—Ay and Horemheb—became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court~ although Ay might also have been the maternal uncle of Akhenaten as a fellow descendant of Yuya and Tjuyu.Ay may have married the widowed Great Royal Wife and young half-sister of Tutankhamun~ Ankhesenamun~ in order to obtain power; she did not live long afterward. Ay then married Tey~ who was originally Nefertiti's wet-nurse.Ay's reign was short. His successor was Horemheb~ a general during Tutankhamun's reign whom the pharaoh may have intended as his successor in case he had no surviving children~ which is what came to pass.[10] Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup d'état. Although Ay's son or stepson Nakhtmin was named as his father/stepfather's Crown Prince~ Nakhtmin seems to have died during the reign of Ay~ leaving the opportunity for Horemheb to claim the throne next.Horemheb also died without surviving children~ having appointed his vizier~ Pa-ra-mes-su~ as his heir. This vizier ascended the throne in 1292 BC as Ramesses I~ and was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty.This example to the right depicts a man named Ay who achieved the exalted religious positions of Second Prophet of Amun and High Priest of Mut at Thebes. His career flourished during the reign of Tutankhamun~ when the statue was made. The cartouches of King Ay~ Tutankhamun's successor appearing on the statue~ were an attempt by an artisan to "update" the sculpture.[11]The Eighteenth Dynasty empire conquered all of Lower Nubia under Thutmose I.[12] By the reign of Thutmose III~ the Egyptians directly controlled Nubia to the Nile river~ 4th cataract~ with Egyptian influence / tributaries extending beyond this point.[13][14] The Egyptians referred to the area as Kush and it was administered by the Viceroy of Kush. The 18th dynasty obtained Nubian gold~ animal skins~ ivory~ ebony~ cattle~ and horses~ which were of exceptional quality.[12] The Egyptians built temples throughout Nubia. One of the largest and most important temples was dedicated to Amun at Jebel Barkal in the city of Napata. This Temple of Amun was enlarged by later Egyptian and Nubian Pharaohs~ such as Taharqa.After the end of the Hyksos period of foreign rule~ the Eighteenth Dynasty engaged in a vigorous phase of expansionism~ conquering vast areas of the Near-East~ with especially Pharaoh Thutmose III submitting the "Shasu" Bedouins of northern Canaan~ and the land of Retjenu~ as far as Syria and Mittani in numerous military campaigns circa 1450 BC.[15][16]Radiocarbon dating suggests that Dynasty XVIII may have started a few years earlier than the conventional date of 1550 BC. The radiocarbon date range for its beginning is 1570–1544 BC~ the mean point of which is 1557 BC.[18]The pharaohs of Dynasty XVIII ruled for approximately 250 years (c. 1550–1298 BC). The dates and names in the table are taken from Dodson and Hilton.[19] Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (designated KV). More information can be found on the Theban Mapping Project website.[20] Several diplomatic marriages are known for the New Kingdom. These daughters of foreign kings are often only mentioned in cuneiform texts and are not known from other sources. The marriages were likely to have been a way to confirm good relations between these states.[21]
